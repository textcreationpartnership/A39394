            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Bleſſing of Peace and Union is ſo eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially neceſſary to every Community, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to that which is to ſucceed the firſt Chriſtian Colledge of the Apoſtles in their carriage and calling, that 'tis the very Life which gives ſuch Bodies both their Being and Beauty. 'Twas that which our bleſſed Saviour breathed upon his Apoſtles with his own ſacred mouth, when he gave them their Apoſtolical Miſſion; <hi>Pax vobis, ſicut me miſit Pater, ita &amp; Ego mitto vos:</hi> And 'tis that which we ſo much prize that no
<pb facs="tcp:108708:2"/>Conſideration can be ſo dear to us as the preſerving ſo in eſtimable a Iewel. Nay, we judge that even a Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, which may breed ſome diſquiet, is diſallowable, if order may be taken to ſecure our peace by any other means. But, when we find by too late and dear expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience that our bearing with former injuries and calu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mnies againſt our perſons and Church, begets nothing but a more violent proceeding in them; when we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that our long ſuffering finds no other effect but an implacableneſs in contentious, uncharitable and ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious carriage; the ſame love of Peace obliges us, though unwilling, to lay open the ſource of all the diſunion and diſaſters our poor Church hath ſuffer'd theſe late years; ever ſince, through our too charitable ſilence and conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence Doctor <hi>Leyburn</hi> was permitted to gain ſo much opinion and authority as to be able to hurt her. Some particular paſſages of whoſe Demeanor we thought good to ſignifie to you our Brethren by this our Encycli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Epiſtle; that being forewarn'd you may more warily avoid a compliance with any Diſturbers of our quiet or Commencers of Schiſm in our Body.</p>
                  <p>'Till about the year 1648. or the beginning of —49. our Clergy enjoy'd an happy and peaceable Union; the Chapter having good intelligence both with their Biſhop and their Brethren: not the leaſt noiſe of ſiding and gathering into Factions being heard among them. About which time Dr. <hi>Leyburn</hi> was ſent into <hi>England</hi> by my Lord, Vicar General <hi>in ſolidum.</hi> In <hi>Auguſt</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing there was held a General Chapter; Mr. <hi>Fitton</hi> came from <hi>Paris</hi> ſent by our Biſhop to preſide in our Chapter as Dean. The Chapter-men from all their Diſtricts being met, Mr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> (againſt the known order and rule of ſuch meetings) brings thither, without
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:108708:2"/>the Dean's notice, two other which were not of the Chapter; The Dean civilly told them the nature of ſuch meetings permitted only Capitular men to be preſent, Hereupon they retir'd; and it was order'd, that two ſhould be ſent to them from the Chapter to give them reaſons for their non admittance. One of them was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, the other vow'd revenge. Mr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> took their non-admittance as a great wrong done to himſelf; and had many conteſts with our worthy Dean about it in the time of the Aſſembly; which was ended with much ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to all others except Mr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> Who, after the Aſſembly, draws a party to himſelf, alledging all was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by Mr. <hi>Harrington</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gage.</hi> Inſomuch that the Chapter in and about <hi>London,</hi> found a Schiſm inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly brought into the Clergy by Mr. <hi>Leyb</hi>'s, means. To ſtop the encreaſe of which they deſir'd a meeting with Mr. <hi>Leyb</hi> as the root from which it grew, and Mr. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington</hi> writ a letter to invite him. All met, ſave Mr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> and another who was ſick. Only a letter came from Mr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> not to Mr. <hi>Harrington,</hi> who had writ to him, and was his equall and fellow-Vicar, but to Mr. <hi>Herbert,</hi> deſiring to know the reſult of the meeting. Mr. <hi>Harring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> waving this affront, to ſhew the deſire he had of gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Mr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> to an union, if poſſible, order'd two of the Company to acquaint him that if he could not or would not come to them, they would all come to him; He anſwer'd, they might come. All went, and being ſate, he preſently fell very foul in words upon Mr <hi>Gage,</hi> and could not be brought to any manner of condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency unto them by any perſwaſions, and ſo after an hours wrangling, all left him.</p>
                  <p>After this Mr. <hi>Clifford</hi> coming into <hi>England,</hi> did by my Lord Biſhop's Order endeavour to bring him to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:108708:3"/>with his Brethren, which he refus'd, unleſſe they would yield to him in an unreaſonable demand, which was neither in his Patent as Vicar-General, nor (as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf confeſt) had he any particular Order from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to exact it. Mr. <hi>Clifford</hi> deſir'd him to referre it to the Chapter; but he refus'd again, ſaying, he would not referre the matter in difference to the Chapter, but <hi>to the ancient Priests,</hi> that is, to a few private perſons of his own faction; for ſcarce any ancient Prieſts of the Chapter (though there were many) but he had diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd them by particular quarrels. And ſo Mr. <hi>Clifford</hi> return'd, leaving him as irreconcileable as he found him.</p>
                  <p>Finding no wayes to prevent Mr. <hi>Leyb</hi>'s. fomenting Diviſions among the Clergy, even in his abſence at <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> the Conſult in <hi>London</hi> reſolv'd to ſummon a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Chapter, which met accordingly <hi>Iuly</hi> 10. 1653. But Dr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> and his friend who had vow'd revenge for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly (though to end all quarrels kindly invited thither) effected that my Lord ſent his Mandate to diſſolve the Aſſembly as met to out him from his Epiſcopal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; They amaz'd at ſuch a groundleſſe malice, proteſt their innocency to my Lord. Mr. <hi>Leyb</hi>'s friend gave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his hand that the letter he writ Dr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> to ſend my Ld, was alter'd in one part of it, and that himſelf feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the reſt, <hi>to ſee how they who preach patience and charity to others, could endure a wrong done themſelves.</hi> They are his own words in his own hand yet extant. Now this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd letter paſſing through Dr. <hi>Leyb</hi>'s. hand to my Lord, my Lord expreſſing that he had it <hi>à perſonis fide dignis,</hi> Mr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> writing at the ſame time to my Lord, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſing his friends letter, upon the receipt of which two letters immediately iſſued the Mandate; 'tis no hard
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:108708:3"/>matter to perceive plainly who was joyn'd with that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informer, and ſo made my Lord expreſſe them plurally. Upon examination, my Lord confeſt himſelf miſlead by falſe ſuggeſtions, and promis'd not to lend ſo eaſy creduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the future. Yet ſtill we were as far from union as formerly,</p>
                  <p>For the whole Aſſembly writing a civill and conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending letter to Dr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> entreating him to keep corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency with Mr. <hi>Harrington,</hi> and give him timely no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſuch Miſſionaries as he ſent into <hi>England,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Harrington</hi> might be the better enabled to provide places for them; Mr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> in his letter to Mr. <hi>Peterſon</hi> utterly diſavow'd ever writing to Mr. <hi>Harrington,</hi> or ſending Miſſionaries to him, or of communicating with him or with Mr. <hi>Blacklow</hi> in the leaſt; and this was after my Ld. (as appears by his letters to Mr. <hi>Walton</hi>) was ſo ſorry for the injury he had done Mr. <hi>Harrington,</hi> that he continued correſpondence with him to his dying day, and alſo profeſt he ſhould hereafter <hi>love him more then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi> Mr. <hi>Peterſon</hi> in his reply demanded why he ſhould ſcruple to keep correſpondence with Mr. <hi>Harrington</hi> more then his Predeceſſours and our Biſhop himſelf did, and the Clergy both here and abroad do upon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? or with Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> more then Dr. <hi>Hyde</hi> did, who knew well Mr. <hi>Bl</hi>'s. Opinions, yet ſent to him to live with him in the Colledge; which he did, with all love, peace, and exemplarity. Mr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> in his reply alledg'd <hi>exceptions againſt Mr.</hi> Bl. <hi>for approving Mr.</hi> Damport<hi>'s book;</hi> That <hi>no man knew the ſence of the ancient Prieſts</hi> (a ſpecious word he ever us'd, to oppoſe the Chapter with) <hi>better then he did,</hi> and <hi>that he was not to be taught.</hi> Which was all could be obtain'd of him. So that the due order of ſending Miſſionaries hither (in which conſiſted a main
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108708:4"/>part of our Union) was utterly broken by his refuſing Communion with our principal Officer.</p>
                  <p>It was propos'd to Vote in the Aſſembly of 1653. That, ſeeing the Preſident of the Colledge of <hi>Doway</hi> is to be nominated by his <hi>Holineſs,</hi> from whom he receives his Authority, independent from the Clergy, inſomuch that the Superiour of the Clergy (notwithſtanding the many great ſummes the Clergy hath given and procur'd to be given to that Colledge) hath not power upon any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion whatſoever to place either Prieſt or Scholar in that Colledge but by way of entreaty, which many times hath met with rejection; it be conſulted whether it may not be fit all the Clergy be advis'd to treat with ſuch as give Alms to that Colledge that their Donations be ſo left to the Diſpoſe of the Clergy; that they may have power to raiſe a ſtock thereby, and that they may apply the rents thereof towards the maintenance of ſuch as the Clergy ſhall think fit to commend to that Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                  <p>This Point was by the Aſſembly thought fit to be waved for that time for fear of diſguſting of D. <hi>Ley.</hi> who notwithſtanding having notice of this Propoſal, which proceeded no further then a motion, and (though held reaſonable yet) was put off for his ſake, calumniated the whole Aſſembly, that it went about to take away all cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Donations to the Colledge: which we leave to your Wiſdomes to judge how true it is; as alſo, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it may not now be fit to put that point in execution, as occaſion ſhall offer.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards my Ld. conſtituted Mr. <hi>Andrew Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> his Vicar-General, a very virtuous and good man; to whom Dr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> ſent a letter, deſiring him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the contents of it to our Brethren; which

His requeſt was unanimouſly and equally granted by all; but of the printing or the manner of his writing not a word ſpoken, or thought mov'd; Leave obtain'd, he
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:108708:5"/>replies in a like return of language as Mr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> had uſed; and to ſave charges of tranſcribing prints it, but took or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Copies ſhould come only to the hands of our Brethren whom it concern'd. Mr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> replies furiouſly, prints his Pamphlet, and publiſhes it to the Laity in the firſt place by expreſſe order of his letters, ſo that even Proteſtants came to the ſight of it, In it he names the chief members of the Clergy about <hi>London</hi> in thoſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous times, vilifies the Conſult (who had not provok't nor medled with him) by unworthy and contemptible termes, and diſgraces the Sub-Deanſhip with falſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſions; which two Acts of his break aſunder all that little union he had left among them. He brings to light unneceſſarily buſineſſes concerning the Government of the Chapter; he thanks two for not concurring with their votes, whereas one of them did as much as the reſt (that is, agreed Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> ſhould clear himſelf) the other was abſent and knew nothing of the buſineſſe. Alſo in a private letter he accuſes another of concurring with us in our votes againſt him in that meeting, who was not then in the Kingdome; and another to have been Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor or Secretary to Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> who proteſts he knew not of the thing, nor the printing it, 'till it was done. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, in that Libel he ſeditiouſly endeavours to ſet divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion between the Conſult and their Brethren in the Countrey by bearing them in hand that <hi>the Conſult abuſes</hi> them. The many falſifications and calumnies which his Adverſary made appear in this his Libel we omit as belonging to their private quarrel, which we were ſo far from eſpouſing in behalf of one ſide or other, that we condemn'd and blam'd both parties manner of proceeding. What we inſiſt on is, that we proteſt in the ſight of God and Man, we gave him not the leaſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108708:5"/>by any Vote of our's to be offended at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult; and yet received from him (and that in Print too to be publiſh't to the Laity) ſo many unſufferable abuſes, and ſeditious calumnies and accuſations.</p>
                  <p>About the ſame time he writ this Letter to Mr. <hi>Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> that he might ſet all his Engines awork at once, his particular friend Mr. <hi>Catterick</hi> Arch-Deacon of <hi>York,</hi> whoſe indiſcreet Zeal, miſled perhaps by Dr. <hi>Leyb.</hi>'s great words and Saint-like proteſtations (of which he is noted by perſons of honour to be too careleſly laviſh) had totally ſubmitted it ſelf to his conduct, began to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to communicate with us, telling us flatly in his Letter of <hi>Ian.</hi> 1656. that <hi>He would give no vote nor have any hand amongst us;</hi> that <hi>We disgrac't our Clergy at home and abroad,</hi> &amp;c. Alſo in his Letters of <hi>Sept.</hi> 24. 1656. that We were <hi>held a Schiſmatical Clergy:</hi> and in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Mr. <hi>Thomas Medcalf</hi> of <hi>Octob.</hi> 13. 1656. that <hi>he recall'd his Vote,</hi> that <hi>he would not aſſent to any thing we doe, becauſe we went on in a Schiſmatical way not only to the diſgrace of our Body but of our whole Nation:</hi> He writ alſo divers diſobedient and refractory Letters to his Vicar Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Dr. <hi>Blundeſton.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While our Church was torn by theſe inteſtine Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, it pleaſed the Right honourable Ld. Abbot <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ague</hi> (never to be mention'd by us but with grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and honour for his love then ſhewn our Body) with our Venerable Brethren in <hi>France</hi> Dr. <hi>Holden,</hi> Mr. <hi>Clif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> and Mr. <hi>Carr,</hi> to interpoſe and endeavour to bring the Two to an accord. Mr. <hi>Clifford</hi> alſo and Mr. <hi>Carr</hi> out of their great Charity and Zeal of our Union took a journey to <hi>Doway</hi> to treat with Dr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> about it, and to bring him to ſome terms of correſpondency. Moreover, a common Letter was writ by the four mention'd, to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108708:6"/>Dr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> complaining that out <hi>Unity in</hi> Yorkſhire <hi>was actually broken by his ſpecial friend Mr.</hi> Catterick <hi>who ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniated the Chapter as ſchiſmatical, and refus'd flatly to conſent to any thing it ſhould doe; diſobeying and writing offenſive Letters to his Vicar-General</hi> Dr. Blundeſton; <hi>ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly requesting him to deſiſt from all ſchiſmatical reſiſting that authority, which our two late Biſhops of happy memory had eſtabliſh't and left amongſt us, that he ought not to goe about to remedy abuſes by open reſiſtence, this being the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon pretext of all rebellion agaiſt Authority, That the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church hath her legal and authoritative way both ſubalternal and ſupreme to examine and condemn whatever may be amiſse either in his or any other man's writings whatſoever; That particular men can only inform thoſe whoſe office it belongs to, of what they judge erroneous or dangerous, though as friends and Brethren we may cover what we think we are not neceſſarily obliged to complain of, That Information once given we ought to forbear all ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous &amp; clamorous defamation till the Delinquent be ſentenc't; That they could not expect, much leſſe exact and demand of Mr.</hi> Bl. <hi>that he ſhould renounce his Doctrines till they knew what and how by an authentick cenſure, That they heartily deſire both of them and all our Brethren, they would cordially embrace our last Biſhop's pious advice and prudent Council given in ſeveral Letters to Dr.</hi> Leyb. <hi>himſelf and others, to forbear all Acts of ſiding and faction tending to ſchiſm and Diviſion as being much worſe then all Mr</hi> Bl's. <hi>Novelties:</hi> Thus they. Alſo by their Letters to Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> they dealt with him to give under his hand a ſubmiſſion of his writings to the Church and See Apoſtolick, which was what Mr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> deſir'd of him, and with which he profes't he would reſt ſatisfi'd. The ſumme of which Profeſſion (as we have it ſubſcrib'd by his own

                  <p>
                     <hi>VVhereas I under-written have heretofore given a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion of my writings to the holy Church and See-Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick to ſatisfie ſuch as might doubt of my obedience to the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:108708:7"/>Pope. And that notwithſtanding I gave it as full and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as poſsibly I could according as my true intention then was, now is, ever hath been, and ever ſhallbe, God willing; I hear that ſome have miſunderſtood it, and have conceived that I intended only by thoſe words [Holy Church and See-Apostolick] the Catholick Church and Pope conjoyntly; but not the See of</hi> Rome <hi>and S.</hi> Peter<hi>'s ſucceſſour the Pope, ſeparate from a General Council: as alſo that I only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd my opinion but profeſſed no actual ſubmiſsion of my writings: I therefore do now ingenuouſly and freely declare and profeſſe that it is my opinion and judgement, all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks ought in heart and in all humility and obedience to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their Divinity writings not only to the Holy Church in common and in a General Council, where the Pope may be in perſon, or by his Deputies, but alſo to the particular See of</hi> Rome, <hi>&amp; S.</hi> Peter<hi>'s Succeſsour the Pope, even out of a General Council; which as I have alwaies done in my heart, ſo doe I now likewiſe actually and willingly ſubmit all my writings to the particular See of</hi> Rome <hi>and S.</hi> Peter<hi>'s Succeſſor the Pope, even out of a General Council; and this according as my opinion &amp; belief hath ever taught me. Ratifying &amp; confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this effect all the contents of my former ſubmiſsion. In witneſs whereof I have hereunto ſet my hand this</hi> 2. <hi>Iuly</hi> 57. thus Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> The Conſult likewiſe &amp; the particular perſons, he had ſo cauſeleſly and publickly injured in print, wav'd the clearing themſelves, and demanding ſatisfaction, and Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi>'s Reply to his Pamphlet, though printed and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be publiſh't, was held in by him, &amp; Mr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to have the laſt word. By theſe condeſcentions and actual performances ſo amply and ſatisfactorily on Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi>'s part, this charitable forbearance on the Conſults, and (as it then ſeem'd) theſe faithfull and truly intended promiſes on Mr. <hi>Leyb.</hi>'s (being given under his own
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108708:7"/>hand with ſo ſolemn an engagement to ſuch Venerable perſons all our Brethren and Catholicks) all things ſeemed to conſpire to a perfect union. To compleat which by Mr. <hi>Leyb.</hi>'s performance of what he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis't, a General Aſſembly of the Chapter at the requeſt of the Mediators was call'd, whither Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> and Dr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> were invited. It met <hi>Nov.</hi> 23. 1657. Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in perſon. Dr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> ſent his Agent: who at the very entrance of our meeting, ſhew'd us how ſoon Dr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> had forgot his promiſe, and that all Union with him was hopeleſs by his excepting againſt the whole Aſſembly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was of Chapter men only, and alledging, <hi>He was ſent to an Aſsembly of the whole Clergy:</hi> whereas the whole Clergy being ſome hundreds, could not poſſibly meet in thoſe times, nor indeed at any time (without leaving all <hi>England</hi> deſtitute) but by their Repreſentatives and Superiours, who were the natural Deputies of the Diſtricts. He began to preſs alſo the diſclaiming and cenſuring Doctrines in the firſt place ere he would treat or any waies concurre with us towards the obtaining a Biſhop; He gives in a paper in Dr. <hi>Leyb.</hi>'s name, and as his Agent, containing many unjuſt accuſations againſt our Chapter and it's proceedings. He urges violently both in his words and his Vote (as alſo did Mr. <hi>Young</hi> Mr. <hi>Catterick</hi>'s Deputy) and expreſt the ſame in his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that Dr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> might be propos'd for a Biſhop; and laſtly (all the reſt unanimouſly concurring) he and Mr. <hi>Catterick</hi>'s Agent at the end of the Aſſembly, refus'd in plain terms to ſubſcribe to the Votes of the Major part (which common reaſon tells every one is the manner of all publick meetings) and gave under their hands their reaſons, that, <hi>being Deputies they could not exceed their Commiſsions:</hi> By which 'tis apparent that their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:108708:8"/>or Orders were that they ſhould make no U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, nor have any Communication with us as far as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd the Acts of our Aſſembly; which reach't to a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great part of our Church-Diſcipline, our petitioning his Holineſs for a Biſhop, the eſtabliſhing and compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Chapter, and divers other moſt conſiderable points to the advantage of our Body. Though the ſame Deputies ſubſcrib'd to the Narrative of the carriage and tranſactions of the Aſſembly as truly related: which to any one who reads the Acts themſelves will abundantly juſtifie the ſincerity and impartialneſs of our proceedings there.</p>
                  <p>Thus ended the General Aſſembly of 1657. intended by the Mediatours and us to conclude a peace by Dr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> to proſecute his revengefull and implacable hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, againſt Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> and withall (as we upon good grounds fear) his own ambitious ends.</p>
                  <p>The Inſtitute of <hi>Noſtre Dame de Vertu</hi> near <hi>Paris</hi> under the reverend Fathers of the Oratory, whoſe whole courſe of life breaths nothing but paſtoral and Clerical, was ſuch an advantage to the Clergy and Church of <hi>England,</hi> as was not to be hop'd for by any ſolicitation of our Wiſhes, much leſs to be offerr'd us out of a voluntary charity, by the moſt Reverend General of that ſolidly pious Body. There might our Brethren have a place of retirement after their Scholaſtical ſtudies in Colledges or diſtractions in <hi>England;</hi> to prepare, diſpoſe or refreſh themſelves in order to their ſpiritual and Sacerdotal me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of living, and to enable and facilitate themſelves in the beſt practiſes of Paſtoral functions; this was look't on by our moſt pious and learned Biſhop of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> as a bleſſing from Heaven upon our perſecuted Church; who the laſt journey he ever made, coming to that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:108708:8"/>houſe, and ſeeing and bleſſing the Society of <hi>Engliſh</hi> then preſent, he ſaid, that <hi>his Eyes had ſeen that which his heart had deſired, and he had endeavoured for thirty yeares before.</hi> This Inſtitute was put forward by the charity and favour of that moſt religious Order and moſt venerable General, embrac't and advanc't by us to our utmoſt; and more had been done, had Dr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> permitted our Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter to have the due influence it had otherwiſe enjoy'd; This was very much extoll'd by the gratefull return of moſt high commendations by our pious Brethren who came from thence; and laſtly, this was moſt zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly promoted by the heroick charity and patience of our moſt honoured and venerable Brother Dr. <hi>Gough;</hi> who in the midſt of all diſcouragements and oppoſitions from thoſe Colledges, whoſe Governours belonging to another Body ſaw better then many of our ſelves, how conſiderable that proffer was to our Clergy, and ſtrove by all means to divert their Subjects from going thither, yet ſtill to his great expence and labour preſerv'd it on foot, till Dr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> by articling with him in moſt unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and unhandſome terms, and propoſing conditions moſt ſenſleſſe to be comply'd with e're he would ſend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more thither (as if Dr. <hi>Gough</hi> and not our Body had receiv'd the benefit) quite diſheartned and extinguiſh'd the fervency of that zeal; the impoſſibility of ſucceſſe, and it's progreſſe being too apparent, unleſſe Dr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> would leave off that uncomplying humour and come to better terms.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time our Venerable Dean having acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted the Deanſhip upon the Letters of the Aſſembly, and the conditions being comply'd with which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd e're he could conveniently ſettle in <hi>London,</hi> came up to reſide amongſt us; and our Church began to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:108708:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>cloſe to an hearty Union through the general love and reſpect every one bore him. Nay, even Dr. <hi>Leybs.</hi> moſt unreaſonable friend Mr. <hi>Catterick</hi> being unſolicited by him of late, and left to himſelf, began to come to better terms: when the times opening and giving a freer paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage for Dr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> he reſolv'd to come in perſon to blaſt our hopefull Union in the bud. Before Mr. <hi>Bl</hi>'s. preſence in our Conſults was his greateſt corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and his excluſion mainly preſs'd, which made us hope his ſo far removal now from our Countrey and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe would ſatisfie and pacifie him. Yet ſtill (no conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration being had to the former Agreement, and Mr. <hi>Bl</hi>'s. complyance on his part by ſubmitting his writings) the old tune of <hi>Declaming,</hi> ſo ungratefull to the eares of our Reverend Biſhop, our General Aſſemblies and the Mediatours, is ſung to us, and our Brethren in town ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditiouſly ſolicited to ſubſcriptions. Our Chapter and Venerable Dean's authority, though his own Agent (as it happen'd) voted for his election in the Aſſembly, is diſavow'd by him; If we viſit any perſon of honour who is a friend to Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> he objects our common civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to him as ſuch an heinous fault, as if we had treated with an excommunicated perſon. His unconſcientious and raſh cenſures even upon mens ſouls and their future eternal ſtate, as if he were ſent to paſſe judgement upon both the quick and the dead, we have both horrour to hear and ſhame in his behalf (conſidering his function) to relate. Mr. <hi>Mark Harrington</hi> our late Sub-Dean, whoſe exemplar life and pious death were precious in the ſight of heaven and earth, he judges to have dy'd in a ſad caſe. Honour'd Dr. <hi>Blundeſton</hi> Vicar-General of the <hi>North,</hi> a perſon of eminent learning and exemplar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, receiving an hurt by a fall from his horſe, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:108708:9"/>not long after dying, is ſentenc't to have been thus pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh't by God's juſt judgement for being a friend to Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> A learned <hi>Benedictin,</hi> who reſpected Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> being ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> by his own Order in the time of the Plague, and dying of the infection there, is pronounc't to have this ſignal Judgement light upon him for favouring Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> Another Prieſt yet living becauſe held a particular friend to the ſame perſon, is doom'd by his laviſh cenſure to have utterly and irrecoverably loſt his ſoul; and this proclaim'd by him in divers companies; All the Prieſts that have faln from faith of late, though out of known licentiouſneſſe or Scepticiſm, are given out by Dr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> to have fal'n becauſe friends to Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> whereas none of them were ever his Scholars, or had any friendſhip or converſation with him, more then common courteſie requir'd. Divers Honourable perſons eſcape no better if he conceive them to diſlike his waies. Our Venerable Dean alſo whom he ſees his principal cauſe of our Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo moſt hindring his making himſelf a party and promoting a Schiſm in our Body, is particularly piqu't at by him, could he find any hold to faſten his Calumnies upon him. Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> being abſent, (and Dr. <hi>Leyb</hi>'s. faſhion having ever been to have a quarrel with ſome particular perſon, to gain a pretence not to joyn with the common) he falls upon our Secretary, and begins to ſet him in Mr. <hi>Bl</hi>'s ſtead the object of his anger. Dr. <hi>Leyb</hi>'s. two friends Mr. <hi>Catterick</hi> &amp; Mr. <hi>Young</hi> coming to town to meet him, the Conſult, that they might leave nothing unattempted on their part, which Charity could ſuggeſt, reſolv'd to wave Mr. <hi>Catterick</hi>'s defaming them for Schiſmaticks, and we friendly invited them to meet with us to hear what ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction we ſhould give them, both concerning the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of our Chapter, as alſo to the complaints they had
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:108708:10"/>againſt a certain Letter of our Secretaries written by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Conſults. We had hopes giv'n too that Dr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> would be preſent, which we were heartily glad to hear. They ſeem'd willing to meet, being come as they ſaid purpoſely to <hi>London</hi> to unite with us. But, the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the intended meeting Dr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> told our Dean, that he would not come in the place where our Secretary was, and therefore if he were to be there he would not come. The other two met us, but our Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary (who by reaſon of his place as Canon, his office as Secretary, and his being the party accus'd ought not to be abſent) coming in and civilly ſaluting them, Mr. <hi>Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terick</hi> turn'd his head to the door, went out without bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding farewel to any of the grave perſons aſſembled for their ſakes, the other follow'd him; and ſo without leave taking or affording us a word at our Meeting, or ſo much as giving notice to ſome of our Brethren who had made them a civil invitation as Gueſts, &amp; obtain'd a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of their coming, away they went back into <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> carrying along with them, as we are inform'd, Dr. <hi>Leyb</hi>'s. Order to gather the hands of divers there; which is the ſeditious way he ſtill takes, notwithſtanding the Command or Counſel of ſo many Reverend, Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and ſober perſons to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Having ſeen how unappeaſable and uncharitable Dr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> ſtill declares himſelf in his whole carriage againſt Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> and all he conceives friends to him, it were not amiſs to deſire our Brethren to reflect upon what he gave under his own hand formerly, and to which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd himſelf ſo ſolemnly, that <hi>if Mr.</hi> Bl. <hi>ſhould make a ſubmiſsion of his Writings he would for the future reſpect and honour him with as great ſincerity and real affection as any friend or Brother alive; and the ſame upon the ſame
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:108708:10"/>ſcore, all who may be eſteem'd his Adherents;</hi> and then leave to their judgements to conſider and determine whether he hath the leaſt regard of common principles of honeſty; of any agreement, engagement, proteſtation of ſincerity, or of what he gives under his hand, or even any civil reſpect for the Honourable and worthy perſons, our Brethren or Catholicks in general, to whom he made this engagement, who, without any offence given him, nay all poſſible condeſcenſions us'd towards him, aſſoon as his fair promiſe had obtain'd from his Adverſary the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions he requir'd, careleſly &amp; boldly breaks through all theſe ties &amp; conſiderations, to proſecute his former anger with the ſame or a greater fierceneſſe and violence?</p>
                  <p>Divers other things Dr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> &amp; his friends uſe to object to the Chapter; As firſt, Their diſobedience to my Ld. Biſhop in making Mr. <hi>Harrington</hi> Sub Dean of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter without his Order. Secondly, for calling the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſſembly held <hi>Iuly</hi> 1653. without leave had firſt from the Biſhop. Thirdly, that though the ruling part of the Chapter in <hi>London</hi> ſtill ſay they deſire a Biſhop. Yet their intentions are thought to be otherwiſe, and that they mean to rule and govern in a Capitular way without a Biſhop.</p>
                  <p>To the firſt it is anſwer'd, 'Tis true, my Lord Biſhop writ to thoſe of the Chapter in <hi>London,</hi> taxing them for making Mr. <hi>Harrington</hi> Sub-Dean without his Order, which they could not doe; but the Chapter return'd Anſwer to his Lordſhip that Mr. <hi>Fitton</hi> their Dean being to leave <hi>England</hi> order'd Mr. <hi>Harrington</hi> Sub-Dean in his place till his return, This all the Chapter agreed to, and this Dr. <hi>Leyb</hi> his Lordſhips Vicar General knew and made no complaint of. Again it was not the dignity of Sub-Dean Mr. <hi>Fitton</hi> and the Chapter confer'd on Mr.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108708:11"/>
                     <hi>Harrington,</hi> but only order'd for the time he ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in all Capitular meetings, which by virtue of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ancient'ſt Canon he might lawfully do, without leave from the Biſhop, and with this Anſwer ſent to my Lord, His Lordſhip was very well ſatisfi'd. To the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond we anſwer, That being the General Aſſembly was only a Capitular meeting to conſult and order ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as might be for the good of the Clergy; and that all their votes and reſolves therein were to be preſented to his Lordſhip for his Approbation or Rejection there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, there was no more diſobedience to his Lordſhip in calling that General Chapter then there was in calling any other Chapter or Capitular meeting thereof weekly or monethly held, eſpecially there being no difference at all between his Lordſhip and the Chapter. And the reaſon why the Chapter did not write to my Lord Biſhop of this General Aſſembly was their fear they had Dr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> would uſe means to make my Lord forbid it.</p>
                  <p>In anſwer to the third you may be pleas'd to know, that in the year 1653. it was propos'd in a Capitular Conſult (Dr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> being one of them) to move my Lord Biſhop to admit of a Coadjutor as the beſt means to continue the ſucceſſion of Biſhops in the Clergy. But Dr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> being of opinion that the having a Coadjutor would ſhorten his Lordſhips life, it was then waved. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Dr. <hi>Hyde</hi> after writing to the Chapter that their friends at <hi>Paris</hi> together with my Lord of <hi>Andover</hi> had mov'd my Lord Biſhop therein, and that ſome Letters (of which we have Copies) paſt between my Lord Biſhop and my Lord of <hi>Andover</hi> concerning that buſineſſe, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding my Lord of <hi>Andover</hi> out of his noble Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and Charity to us had made offer (if the Chapter would ſend him their Commiſſion to act their buſineſſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:108708:11"/>for them) to go to <hi>Rome</hi> and in their names to ſolicite for a Co-adjutor: yet the Chapter ſtill reply'd, (with their humble thanks to his Lordſhip) that they could not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in that point without my Lord Biſhops conſent, whoſe ſatisfaction they eſteem'd more then the hopes they had of a Co-adjutor. And indeed the Chapter in all things poſſible were zealous in maintaining their Biſhops honour and juriſdiction over them; for, ſome Miſſionaries coming from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> and refuſing the Canonical Oath of their Obedience to my Lord Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, alledging they were inform'd his Lordſhip had no Juriſdiction, the ſub-Dean and Chapter of <hi>London</hi> by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the conditions of my Lords delivering up his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal patent, ſatisfy'd them, and all other Prieſts that came after them into <hi>England.</hi> By which 'tis evident, that the Chapter was the principal and onely upholder of my Lords power and Epiſcopal Juriſdiction over the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy againſt all oppoſers; and omitted nothing, either in my Lords life time, or ſince his death, that might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the continuation and ſucceſſion of Biſhops in the Clergy; as their ſending two Agents to their great expence and charge moſt evidently ſhow.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, 'tis objected that divers Prieſts of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of 53. were excommunicated by my Lord for their diſobedience. But the direct contrary is to be ſeen in my Lord's Letter to Mr. <hi>Walton,</hi> in which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quits them and rather puts himſelf in the fault for being too credulouſly perſwaded; promiſing <hi>to love</hi> the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he moſt ſuſpected and by name ſent his Mandate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, <hi>more then ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, they object Dr. <hi>Leyb.</hi>'s uſual calumny That his Holineſs judges our Chapter <hi>Schiſmatical.</hi> But how infamous an untruth this is, both our Agents can atteſt;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:108708:12"/>and that they never received the leaſt rebuke from his Holineſs upon that or any other ſcore; nor yet the leaſt ſignification of any ſuſpition that we held unſound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines. So that we fear (as his cuſtome is here) himſelf endeavour'd to fix that Calumny upon us at <hi>Rome,</hi> hoping the Eccho of it, did it take, might rebound hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to our diſgrace. Beſides how ſenſeleſs is it and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory to his Holineſſes prudence and goodneſs to imagine that he would receive the Agents of Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and treat with them ſo long without endeavouring all the while to reduce them from their Schiſm, nay not ſo much as give them ſome gentle admonition or make the leaſt mention of it!</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, (to come to an end of their petty objections) we are accuſed as uncharitable for denying to pray for Mr. <hi>Ogle</hi>'s Soul. But our Secretary's Letter, which themſelves produce, ſayes the expreſs contrary, in theſe words; <hi>The Conſult agreed and Order'd me to write to our Brethren to recommend Mr.</hi> Ogle<hi>'s Soul to God, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo I have done.</hi> Onely, whereas in the laſt Aſſembly it had been order'd that every Prieſt ſay two Maſſes for any Brother that dies, and ordered likewiſe that none ſhall receive any priviledge or benefit by the Chapter unleſs they acknowledge the Chapter; hence we expres't our ſelves, that <hi>as publick perſons we could not order Suffrages for him in caſe he had dy'd in oppoſition to the Chapter.</hi> So that 'twas onely this benefit order'd in the Aſſembly we ſpoke of, not the private prayers we ow'd him as Chriſtians. Nor was it meant or ſignify'd to be a denial of prayers either publick or private for him, (for the Letter ſhowes we afforded him both) but we intended it as a ſeaſonable and proper admonition to Mr. <hi>Catte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>'s diſobedient humour; which is the true reaſon he
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:108708:12"/>thus without the leaſt ground, exclaims againſt it.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed more cloſe to Dr. <hi>Leyb.</hi>'s main diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties; his greateſt calumnies againſt us at preſent, and which they inſiſt moſt upon, are two; One, that our Chapter has no Authority; next, that we are <hi>Blacklow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts;</hi> whereas, for the former we ſhew him our firſt Biſhops conſtitutive Letters, expreſſing, that, <hi>Poſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turam hac de re habitam deliberationem non tantum cum prudentiſsimis gentis noſtrae hominibus, verum-etiam cum exteris Praelatis ſapientiſsimis, qui ad Epiſcopum ſpectare, inque illius poteſtate ſitum eſse cenſuerunt Decanum &amp; Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulum constituere, illudque ad conſervandam Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem atque Ordinariam Iuriſdictionem omnino expedire.

We ſhow him under Mr. <hi>Fitton</hi>'s own hand, that, It was the ſenſe of Pope <hi>Innocentius</hi> return'd to him by Cardinal <hi>Capponi</hi> our Comprotectour, that <hi>we ſhould govern by a Dean and Chapter 'till we had a Biſhop,</hi> that <hi>he would leave us to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern

                     <hi>death, if he die before any change of Government come upon us by the coming in of one or more Biſhops, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, our Reſolution is, that all the Clergy ſtand in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt defence of the Dean and Chapter, and yield due obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the ſaid Dean and Chapter and to ſuch Vicars and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther officers as they</hi> de jure communi <hi>may and ſhall conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute to continue the Government, till it ſhall pleaſe God and the See-Apostolick to ſend us a Biſhop or Biſhops to govern us, or declare the firſt Inſtitution, and after-Confirmations of the Chapter to be invalid, and ſo the Chapter to be null. In which caſe our Reſolution is that the Dean, Sub-Dean, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars and other officers hold their places of Superiority and Government (but without the names of Dean, Chapter or Vicar) by a voluntary deference of the reſt of the Clergy unto them, till it ſhall pleaſe the See-Apoſtolick to eſtabliſh ſome other Government amongst us; but with this Proviſo &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that the Superiours then exerciſe no power but ſuch as the diffuſed Clergy may by their voluntary ſubmiſsion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer upon them;</hi> This was the order and reſolution of that grave and prudent Aſſembly, being the Repreſentative Body of the whole Clergy, which was after confirm'd by another General Aſſembly of the Chapter held <hi>Nov.</hi> 1657.</p>
                  <p>We produce the Common Letter of the Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Lord Abbot <hi>Montague</hi> and our Brethren in <hi>France,</hi> friendly admoniſhing Dr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> that to <hi>reſiſt the Chapter was ſchiſmatical.</hi> We produce him a Catalogue of our ſeveral Agents and very many Letters ſent to the Pope and Court of <hi>Rome</hi> by our Deans and Chapter, and in their names, collected lately by our preſent Agent at <hi>Rome</hi> out of the Archives there; ſome of them alſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd by Dr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> himſelf, as then Secretary, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticated by a publick Notary.

Yet, all this, enough to convince and ſatisfie even unreaſonableneſs it ſelf, works nothing with him to bring him to an union with us; and to make him joyn with our laſt General Aſſembly towards the obtaining one of the Six there mention'd for a Biſhop; which is all the charitable favour we deſire of him at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
                  <p>His next Calumny is, that we are <hi>Blacklo'ists,</hi> a nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name he affixes, how cauſeleſly ſoever, on all that ſtand in the way of his ambition, that ſo he may diſgrace and remove them. Sometimes he charges Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> with fault of cozenage and injuſtice; as, that he has embez'ld or
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:108708:15"/>converted to other uſes a ſumme of Money left in his hand for the Clergie's good: whereas we know the contrary by divers perſons both Eccleſiaſtick of our own Chapter and Lay-Gentlemen; in whoſe hands and to whoſe truſt he hath left the ſaid ſumme to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd hereafter for the good of the Clergy: Yet if any concurre not with him in this and ſuch like unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able calumnies he is preſently a <hi>Blacklo'iſt.</hi> Sometimes or rather continually, he miſtakes Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi>'s Opinions, or wreſts them to a ſiniſter ſenſe, which the Author never meant; and if any one go about to rectifie his erroneous Judgement, he ſtraitway charges him to have read Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi>'s books, and therefore to be a <hi>Blacklo'ist;</hi> though the perſon charg'd holds oppoſite to Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> in the ſaid points. The like is if any, to oppoſe his uncharitable language, expreſſe a good Opinion of Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi>'s virtue, (which others, even thoſe who moſt diſlike his Tenets confeſs unimpeachable) his very following the common principles of Charity and Chriſtianity ſhall make him too a <hi>Blacklo'iſt,</hi> and fall under the correction of his ſevere cenſure. If any ſober reaſon be calmly produc't and preſt which confounds and non-pluſſes him, he preſently flies back all amaz'd and exclaims, that 'tis <hi>a Suggeſtion of the devil.</hi> If the word <hi>(Rational)</hi> happen to ſlip out in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe he is immediately ſtruck at it and expreſſes great abhorring of it, as being a word Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> uſes. To ſuch a ſtrange heigth does his paſſion tranſport him.</p>
                  <p>Now, his main reaſon why we are <hi>Blacklo'iſts,</hi> is, becauſe we will not declare againſt Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi>'s Doctrines, Our reaſons not to do ſo, are,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Our laſt Biſhops commands in his Letter to Dr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> himſelf, dated <hi>Iuly</hi> 6. 1652. delivered in theſe words, I have divers times written to you to ſuppreſſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:108708:15"/>all clamours againſt Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi>'s novelties, and (as you have written to me) you have ſo done; but ſtill divers of my chief Officers write to me that you do the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which I am very ſorry to hear, for ſo you will cauſe the inconvenience and Schiſm which will be worſe then the Books are.</p>
                  <p>Next by our Reverend Biſhops reaſon giv'n in the ſame Letter, and in theſe wiſe and charitable words, <hi>For Gods love by all means ſeek Charity and Peace, and whiles the See Apostolick ſpeaks not of theſe novelties, you have no need to cry out ſo loud against them; let us follow and not go before our Paſtour, but with love and charity expect his final ſentence.</hi> Which words ſhew alſo, that my Lord was jealous of Dr. <hi>Leyb</hi>'s. diſquiet ſpirit, and thought it ſeaſonable to keep it in due limits by this vehement ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition and exhortation to Charity. Now whereas Dr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> pretends a contrary Order of my Lords, the Letter he ſhewes for it, contains no ſuch thing; but onely that himſelf, being Vicar General, ſhould not own the Doctrine, and that he ſhould ſuppreſſe ſome books of Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi>'s, which were coming over, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting their publiſhing; which is done in a ſilent and quiet way of intercepting or buying them up, not by cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and gathering hands of private perſons, which is the very way of Sedition. And that this was my Lords ſenſe is ſeen in his Letter to Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> written, as appears after Dr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> had thus miſtaken or would ſeem to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take my Lords meaning. <hi>I have been ſo far from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Dr.</hi> Leyb. <hi>to cry out against your Book, that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd him to ſuppreſſe all ſpeech againſt it, as I aſſure you is true, and I hope he will not deny— Perhaps he knowing I much dislik't your Book, gather'd, that I would have him ſpeak againſt it: but whatever he ſayes or gather'd, this is true which I write.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:108708:16"/>Thirdly, by the Orders and Decrees of two General Aſſemblies of -53. and -57. repreſenting the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of the Clergy, who agreed that we ſhould not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs my Lords commands in that point, but follow his grave, fatherly and charitable advice.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, by the Judgement of the right honourable Lord <hi>Abbot Montague</hi> and our Venerable Brethren in <hi>France</hi> in their common Letter of Mediation to Dr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> repeating my Lords advice to him, that <hi>we ſhould follow, not go before our Pastor.</hi> And this was when Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi>'s ſubmiſſion of his Writings to the Church and See Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick ſtolick was not yet made; much leſs can it be exacted of us now, ſince he hath ſubmitted his Doctrine to the Church; for by ſo doing he hath left the controverſie now in the Churches hands, and ſo makes our's or any other's intermedling very improper.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, We are mov'd not to diſclaim Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi>'s Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines by the example of other Bodies and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and particularly that of the Society; who when Tenets written by ſome of their Body, have highly ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daliz'd the World, and were actually cenſur'd by very many Biſhops and his Holineſſe alſo, yet thought it not prudent to make Declarations againſt them themſelves, much leſſe to begin to cenſure them firſt. Nay more, (with reſpect to thoſe grave and prudent Bodies be it ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) we have exceeded the moſt forward of them in this point, having our ſelves upon this occaſion requeſted the <hi>Nuntio</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> (through whoſe hands, as being our Ordinary, Commands from his Holineſs are to come to us legally, to ſend to us any Decree which concern's us, promiſing to receive and publiſh it. We have ſignifi'd alſo the ſame to his Holineſſe and the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to the <hi>Cardinal-Protectour,</hi> the <hi>inter-Nuntio</hi> of <hi>Bruſſels</hi> and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108708:16"/>others, which (as far we know) no other Order has done concerning any of their Body.</p>
                  <p>Now We appeal to all the World, whether it become the gravity of Eccleſiaſtical perſons of our place &amp; voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to neglect the prudent and charitable Counſel and commands of our late Biſhop, &amp; of ſuch venerable perſons as compoſe our Aſſemblies, that is, all the Vicar Generals, Canons and Arch Deacons in <hi>England,</hi> as alſo of the moſt worthy Mediatours, to neglect the example of all other Communities, &amp; the evidence of our own reaſon too, which tells us that a mature and orderly procedure ought to be obſerv'd in ſuch Cenſures; and all this to follow and ſecond the paſſion of one ſingle man, whoſe very moving and ſtirring in ſuch a matter, is beyond his duty, in regard he is but a private perſon, and can ſhew no Order or Commiſſion from any Superiour, is ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an Act of ſedition, that nothing can ſuffice to juſtifie it in the opinion of any ſober man, who ſhall but conſider that the Catholick Church hath Order and Government in it; and that affairs of this nature (determining what is Faith, what Hereſie) are not to be carry'd on by cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and getting hands of a few ignornat or paſſionate Perſons, by ſurprize or miſinformation, but by an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority deriv'd in an orderly and legal manner from the Supreme Biſhop; or, in caſe it be matter of Opinion and not of Faith; then 'tis ſolid and prudent reaſons and not empty and rude noiſes, which are proper to confute ſuch Errours.</p>
                  <p>As for Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi>'s perſon, we have known him to be ever of a moſt unblemiſh't life and exemplar conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; and, as ſuch, we are taught by Chriſtian princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to honour and reſpect him. He hath born many principal Offices under our Clergy, done as many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:108708:17"/>ſervices, and hath been Maſter to very many of our eldeſt and graveſt Brethren; with conſiderations give them and us a gratefull eſteem and reſpect for him. His learning all grant to be eminent; which by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon principles of civility and humanity oblige us to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue him accordingly; and to wiſh and pray he may ſo employ his pen that his other works may be as ſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Gods Church, as thoſe againſt Hereticks have been. But to defend him in any Tenet which may juſtly be conceiv'd againſt Superiours either ſpiritual or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, or againſt Doctrines held forth by the Catholick Church, we abhor in our hearts; for his opinions very few of us know them, few or none underſtand them all; and we ſeriouſly proteſt we know not one of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren who holds all the opinions he maintains; And if ſome hold ſome, what wonder is it, or how is it avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, while 'tis left in the hands of the Schooles, that is, till the Church declare her ſelf what we may hold conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with faith, what not? Yet to give ſatisfaction even in this. Our two laſt General Aſſemblies have unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly declar'd that we will readily <hi>approve or diſapprove all Doctrines and cuſtomes as we ſhall underſtand they are approv'd or diſapprov'd by the See Apoſtolick.</hi> Our Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Dean hath ſent a Declaration to our Officers to be ſubſcrib'd by all Prieſts, that they do condemn <hi>Opinio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Ianſenii aut quorumcunque aliorum novitates à ſancta ſede damnatas;</hi> And we hope our following offers made to Dr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> will ſatisfie any man not very far gone in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and prejudice.</p>
                  <p>Firſt it has been offer'd him that if he will pick out ſome opinions of Mr. <hi>Bl</hi>'s, and make them ſatisfactorily appear to be Hereſies, we ſhould heartily expreſſe our ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of them, which he refuſes to doe, but would
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:108708:17"/>have us condemn them (as he ſtrangely phraſes it) <hi>in globulo;</hi> by which we conceive he mean's <hi>in the bulk.</hi> Whence it would follow that we muſt condemn the Tenets of the Trinity, the Incarnation, and all other my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of our Faith, all theſe being found in Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi>'s Books, and going in the ſame Bulk or Book with the reſt: So that the ſame common Words of Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be levell'd at one as at the other, unleſs ſome diſtinction be made; Which yet he will by no means undertake to doe, but all his heat is to have them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd <hi>in globulo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, It hath bin offer'd him, that if he pleaſe not to engage himſelf in a Diſpute with Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> by particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larizing which opinions he thinks cenſurable, which not; he would pick out thoſe Propoſitions he judg'd moſt dangerous, and we would joyn with him to ſend them to the Univerſity of <hi>Doway</hi> to be cenſur'd as they think fit: which proffer he likewiſe refuſes, telling us, that Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> would fall foul upon that Univerſity to their ſmall content and liking. To which was reply'd, that if they could not or durſt not cenſure them, fearing ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage thereby, how then durſt we, whom we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive himſelf judges neither of greater Authority nor learning then the Doctors there?</p>
                  <p>Moreover our venerable Dean, in preſence of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, offer'd him, that if he would ſelect thoſe Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he judg'd to ſound moſt dangerouſly, we would joyn with him in ſending them to <hi>Rome</hi> to his Holineſſe and requeſting his Cenſure of them, that ſo we might know what to eſchew and what to allow of; and that we would receive this Cenſure thus procur'd and ſent us by our Ordinary, the <hi>Nuntio</hi> at <hi>Paris;</hi> and publiſh it to all our Brethren to be obſerv'd ſtrictly, with as deep an
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:108708:18"/>Injunction as we could lay upon them. But all proffers which have any thing of reaſon in them are equally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accepted by him; and nothing pleaſes his fancie but condemning <hi>in globulo;</hi> that is, good and bad together. Which our judgement gives us is both unreaſonable in us to do, and pernicious to the faithfull, and of whoſe Soules we have the charge.</p>
                  <p>Alſo before Dr. <hi>Leyb</hi>'s. coming, ſome of our Brethren in Town diſſatisfied with ſome particulars of Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi>'s Doctrine, reſolv'd upon a more peaceable, rational and charitable way; which was to gather out of his Books divers Propoſitions moſt liable to exception, and to have them ſent to Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> requiring of him either to explicate them in a Catholick ſenſe, or retract them. This Propoſal of theirs we willingly and readily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac't, and promis't our utmoſt concurrence with them: both becauſe this way tended to the clearing ſomething, &amp; ſo ſome kind of ſatisfaction and utility would redound to the faithfull, one way or other; whereas the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning Opinions confuſedly, without telling which hazards to enſnare the faithfull to abhorre alſo the good ones which run mixt with the bad in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; And Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi>'s way of writing being ſhort and obſcure, unleſſe he were firſt put to explicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, we might happen to engage Authority againſt a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net as held by that Author, whereas perhaps he held the quite contrary; which would injure the good Opinion Governers ought to conſerve, making them ſeem partial, paſſionate, and raſh. Beſide, this method of proceeding ſeem'd well becomming Brethren of the ſame Body; that if upon his explaining himſelf it appear'd he was miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and faultleſs, Charity and brotherly amity might ſtill be preſerv'd with him, and ſo all remain ſtill
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:108708:18"/>united; If evidently faulty and perſiſting in that fault, it might more unanimouſly unite all the reſt againſt him, and render their relinquiſhing him more juſtifiable. But the great fruit we juſtly hop't from this fair procedure, was totally daſh't by their deſiſtence and drawing back about the ſame time Dr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> came; whether by his tampering with them to joyn with him in a more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent courſe, ſo to gain himſelf a faction, will beſt be judg'd from his ſolicitation of other Brethren of ours in town to the ſame purpoſe; and by his Attempts elſewhere, and laſtly by his own words upon this occaſion, that <hi>God would ſend a Bleſsing upon thoſe who ſhould in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite and divide the Clergy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We muſt not omit one very material paſſage; which is, that Dr. <hi>Leyb.</hi>'s friends, Mr. <hi>Catterick</hi> and Mr. <hi>Young,</hi> while in town much inſiſted upon the diſannulling our Chapter, and having a Biſhop without a Chapter; that is, not an ordinary Authority, which by the Canons is to govern with a Chapter, but an Extraordinary one. As alſo Dr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> mov'd to our Dean, and writ to <hi>Rome</hi> falſely pretending that <hi>the greater part of the Clergy in</hi> England <hi>are well ſatisfy'd, and would think themſelves happy in having a</hi> Vicarius Apoſtolicus, <hi>and that onely ſome few of the Chapter oppoſe it.</hi> Now to receive ſuch an Extraordinary Authority is both againſt the pleaſure of HER MAJESTY, our moſt gracious Patroneſs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt in Her Commands to our Agent at <hi>Rome,</hi> not to accept it; againſt the Lawes of our Catholick Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, againſt the will of our State; and ſo moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous for us to admit, ſubjecting us to a <hi>Praemunire</hi> and all who adhere to It or us; Likewiſe, againſt the minds of our Brethren in the two laſt General Aſſemblies, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing to petition for a <hi>Succeſſor to our late Biſhop,</hi> who
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108708:19"/>had <hi>Poteſtatem Ordinarii;</hi> Againſt all the Conſults ſince the laſt General Aſſembly, both in their orders to Mr. <hi>Pendrick</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gage.</hi> And laſtly this ſtriking at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Chapter is both againſt my Lords Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Orders in his Inſtrument whereby he confirm'd the Chapter; againſt the judgement of the Mediatours, againſt the orders of three Popes, nay even againſt Dr. <hi>Leyb</hi>'s. own thoughts formerly (as appears by a letter in his own hand) till his paſſion againſt the Chapter was grown to the height.</p>
                  <p>But put caſe a Biſhop without a Chapter was beſt for us while the Biſhop liv'd, and were neither againſt the command of our Superiours, nor endangering ſecurity; let us conſider what would become of our Church in the vacancy of the ſeat, the Chapter being diſannull'd, what jurisdiction, what order ſhould we have, all being levell'd into an equality, that is, an Anarchy? whence ſhould the Prieſts have extraordinary faculties, when they want them to diſpenſe in vows, degrees of conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity, affinity, marriages contracted or to be contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, abſolving from Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures, Irregularities, and other reſerv'd caſes not contain'd in the ordinary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of their Miſſions, as conſecrating Altar-ſtones, chalices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the want of which power muſt force the Clergy in ſuch neceſſities to repair themſelves, or ſend their Penitents to Regulars (who, as ſo many ſtanding Bodies here are impowr'd with theſe faculties, or may be by their immediate Superiours in every of their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricts) to the great prejudice and unheard of diſhonour of the Clergy. Again, the Chapter being null, how can the Clergy, in the Interval of a Biſhop or Superiour in chief over them, be long kept in due obedience to the decrees and commands of his Holineſſe, or of the Kings
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:108708:19"/>Majeſty, as they are bound in conſcience; when there is no one higher then another, and ſo none at all who has power to receive, publiſh, and enjoyn their obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, or inflict Eccleſiaſtical penalties upon the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders? Beſides, how ſhall the Clergy be able to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Contract with any for pious legacies, or to receive Donations to raiſe a <hi>Found</hi> or common ſtock, to comply with obligations contracted for, which in juſtice they muſt be bound to perform? And in defect of Chapter Officers, to whom ſhall the Contractees have recourſe? not to particular perſons, when each man may with truth ſay, he made no ſuch contract. Laſtly, how can there be any means or way to pay common expences of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, the maintenance of Superiours and under-Officers? To whom ſhall Prieſts be ſent from the reſpective Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges? Who muſt provide from them when newly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd, till they be plac't? Who muſt relieve other indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Prieſts of the Clergy? Who muſt ſend Agents to his Holineſſe, be at the charge of Letters, keep correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency with our Brethren and friends at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, with the Nuncio's, the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> with the Colledges of <hi>Doway</hi> and <hi>Lisbo, &amp;c.</hi> without which the Clergy's affairs can neither be manag'd, nor themſelves ſubſiſt. Wherefore the Government by extraordinary powers being altogether unſecure to us, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by Chapter in the vacancy of the Epiſcopal See, being both <hi>De jure communi Eccleſiaſtico,</hi> and alſo the moſt inoffenſive Government to our State and Laws; nay, a kind of Authority, particularly agreeable to the ſenſe of the King's moſt ſacred Majeſty, our gracious Sovereign, to which we ought humbly to conform, when the neceſſity of maintainingour Catholick profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on obliges not our conſciences to the contrary; much
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:108708:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>more when the ſtream of Catholick Eccleſiaſtical Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons go along with his Commands. Again, it being moſt evident from what hath been ſaid, that the ruine of our Clergy, of it's Unity, it's honour and ſubſiſtence at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the diſannulling of the Chapter; 'Tis likewiſe moſt evident that Attempts to diſannull the ſaid Chapter aim at this ruine of ours. Yet with this diſpoſition of wills Dr. <hi>Leyb</hi>'s. two friends fled from our converſation here, and carry the ſame along with them to communicate to as many as they can perſwade; himſelf in the mean time proſecuting it here to his utmoſt power: What greater diſadvantage could our buſieſt Emulatours wiſh, or even imagine againſt us?</p>
                  <p>We omit for the preſent to lay open at large his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manifold wranglings, calumnies, and paſſionate car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages againſt Dr. <hi>Champney,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> Mr. <hi>Harring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Southcot,</hi> Mr. <hi>Herbert,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gage</hi> Mr. <hi>Peterſon,</hi> Dr. <hi>Holden,</hi> Mr. <hi>Clifford,</hi> Mr. <hi>Carre,</hi> Mr. <hi>Fitton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Manly,</hi> Dr. <hi>Blundeſton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Green,</hi> and (in a word) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt almoſt all the eminent and grave perſons of our Clergy, eſpecially if they were of any authority to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll him in the leaſt, his giving them the lie, his writing againſt them to my Lord, running away from their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies in caſe he were contradicted, and ſuch like; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make a large Hiſtory, were they particularly laid out.</p>
                  <p>Nor do we at preſent much inſiſt upon his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>government in the Colledge, both formerly, and of late more eſpecially; ſo evident and teſtifiable by the Depoſitions of many worthy perſons, too many to be wip't off with a Letter of the Inter-nunce of <hi>Bruſsels,</hi> ſurreptitiouſly procur'd, while none was ſummon'd
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:108708:20"/>to appear there againſt him to enforce and make good the Charge.</p>
                  <p>We only hint the unfitneſſe of ſome he hath ſent hither not long ago as Miſſionaries; As (to omit many others) of one who in another Seminary was deny'd preſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Orders, becauſe of his unſettled brain, and (as we are inform'd) wiſht the next day his throat had been cut when he took Orders.</p>
                  <p>Of another, a perſon in a manner phrenetical, who within ſix or ſeven moneths at moſt, was a marryed man, a Widdower, a Prieſt and Miſſionary.</p>
                  <p>The third, of a wild mad nature, for open Sedition in the houſe and publick ſoliciting all the Scholars to the Warres, was expell'd the Colledge by him; to whom yet, after his expulſion, he ſent faculties to come hither as Miſſionary. He hath now been half a year in <hi>England,</hi> yet never officiates nor performs any duty belonging to a Prieſt.</p>
                  <p>We onely hint theſe few of many at preſent; hoping that the horrour and ſhame expreſt by all who hear of it, and reflect how ſacred the function of a Prieſt and Apoſtle is, will make him more circumſpect for the future; and that theſe are enough to let our Brethren ſee how neceſſary 'tis to have a Dean and Chapter, to examine who are fit, who not, ere they admit them.</p>
                  <p>Alſo theſe few inſtances are ſufficient to ſhew, how unfit he is to govern a Church, who ſo ill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns a private houſe; how unworthy to be a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop who hath ſo little reverence or care of what belongs to that holieſt of functions, Apoſtolical Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
                  <p>But not to inſiſt longer upon his carriage in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:108708:21"/>and to return to his conſtant Demean our here. 'Tis made too manifeſt by the ſeveral contents of this our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance, that all Dr. <hi>Leyb</hi>'s endeavours both former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and at preſent are to diſunite and ſtir up Sedition in our Body, to keep a party on foot for himſelf to work by: to what intent his own Conſcience can beſt tell. But, by his refuſing to joyn with us in obtaining one of the Six propos'd in our laſt General Aſſembly for a Biſhop, and by divers other paſſages we omit, he makes the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon report and opinion an evident Truth, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to make himſelf our Superiour; whom, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare our ſelves freely and conſcientiouſly, we conceive every way unworthy that ſacred Dignity, and much more for his ambitiouſly ſeeking it by ſuch indirect, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable and ſeditious courſes. If this were not his meaning, and that truly he deſires we ſhould have a Biſhop, why ſhould he refuſe to joyn with us in propoſing thoſe Six, they being perſons beyond all Exceptions and even his own; that is, they were never held promoters of Mr. <hi>Bl</hi>'s. Doctrines in the leaſt? Nor, as it ſeems, is he content with aiming at only a bare ſuperiority, but (as appears by his and his friends urging the diſſolution of the Chapter, and the acceptance of an Apoſtolical Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car) he intends to make himſelf Paramount and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolable; not bound to Canonical procedure, nor need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the concurrence or aſſiſtence of any, that ſo he may rule in <hi>Virga ferrea,</hi> and give full ſwing to his revenge and paſſion; Which we experience ſo implacable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the whole Chapter, that we too plainly foreſee no ſacrifice is likely to appeaſe it, but the ruine and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our poor Church.</p>
                  <p>Reflecting then upon Dr. <hi>Leyb</hi>'s. proceedings from firſt to laſt, that he broke the order of Capitular Meetings in
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:108708:21"/>the Aſſembly of 1649. by bringing in private perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Dean's leave: That, he endeavour'd to gather a party of private perſons after the Aſſembly was finiſh't, calumniating the proceedings of his Brethren as illegal, and carry'd on by two perſons only. That, he paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refus'd to come to an accord with his Brethren ſo ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy treating, and ſo charitably deſiring it of him; That, in private debates he contentiouſly refus'd to ſtand to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitratours, himſelf inexorable. That, his friends and he through falſe calumnies mov'd my Lord by his Mandate to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the General Aſſembly of 1653. and thereby inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the whole body of the Clergy in that their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative. That, he refus'd to ſend Miſſionaries to our Chapter-officers though kindly intreated to do it by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from that whole Aſſembly; That contemning our laſt Reverend Biſhop's orders, which were not to cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour againſt Doctrines till condemn'd by the See Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick, ſleighting his cenſure that <hi>this way of proceeding was ſchiſmatical,</hi> and the judgement of two General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies and of the Mediatours to the ſame effect, he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did and ſtill does pertinaciouſly continue to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute this illegal courſe. That, tranſgreſſing and (as much as in him lies) diſannulling the Inſtitutes of our two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Biſhops, the Conceſſions of three Popes to our ſeveral Agents, the ſenſe of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> of divers Cardinals, of our Protectours, of the Congregation <hi>De propaganda fide,</hi> of divers Nuncio's, particularly that of <hi>Paris</hi> (our now Ordinary) expreſt in their Letters to us from time to time as a Chapter; Alſo againſt the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of two General Aſſemblies, ſpeaking the ſence and bearing the place and authority of the whole Clergy, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the judgement and advice of the Honourable and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:108708:22"/>venerable Mediatours (expreſſing in their Letter to him that <hi>to reſiſt the Chapter is Schiſmatical</hi>) he formerly hath and ſtill doth ſlight, vilifie and <hi>reſiſt</hi> the ſaid reverend Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the CHAPTER. Finding alſo that by his printed Libel he endeavour'd to ſow diſcord between the Conſult and their Brethren in the Countrey, falſly and injuriouſly charging them with what they are ready to depoſe they are no wayes guilty of. That, his Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents through his ſuggeſtions diſobeyed their immediate Superiours and writ Letters againſt us, reviling us for <hi>Schiſmatical.</hi> That Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> having perform'd on his part what Dr. <hi>Leyb.</hi> requir'd, by ſubmitting his writings, he perform'd nothing on his, that is, Neither acknowledg'd the <hi>Chapter,</hi> nor deſiſted from calumniating &amp; clamour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wayes to the great injury even of the Mediatours themſelv's, who are oblig'd in honour to endeavour, to their power, to ſee the Conditions comply'd with, and have a right over him to exact it from him. That the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſembly of 1657. meeting to receive his perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of thoſe conditions he had promis't, &amp; ſo compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Union, he by his own and his friends Agent broke them all, clamouring againſt Doctrines, rejecting the Authority of the Chapter, &amp; by his expreſs Commiſſion, refuſing to ſubſcribe to the Votes of the Major part. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he cuts up by the root all poſſibility of accord by his thus openly breaking at pleaſure all Agreements and Engagements, though made to moſt honourable and worthy perſons, given under his own hand, and fortified with ſolemn proteſtations of ſincerity; in preſerving which inviolate, conſiſts all moral honeſty, all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and civil converſation. Seeing that he rejects the Authority of our venerable Dean upon frivolous and falſe pretences; though his own Agent (as it happen'd)

Seeing that by his uncomplying and unreaſonable Demands and Capitulations he hath contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted highly to the diſcouragement of our beſt friends abroad, &amp; to the final breaking up of the Inſtitute of <hi>Noſtre Dame de Virtu'</hi> (deſervedly look't on by us as a moſt conſiderable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to our Clergy. Seeing that he diſaccepted all rational profers made by his brethren to have Doctrines cenſur'd, &amp; calumniates all that will not follow his violent &amp; unlawfull way: Since contemning all charitable &amp; Chriſtian principles, he caſts about his Calumnies &amp; raſh judgements at randome upon the ſouls of perſons both living and dead, long known to us of approv'd vertue and merit, if he hath conceiv'd, how cauſleſly ſoever, a private grudge againſt them; and that he looks upon all both Nobility, Gentry and Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, whom his fancy diſlikes, as on Excommunicate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and ſo carries himſelf towards them; nay expects o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhould do the like under penalty of his heavy cenſure; Seeing his two chief Adherents refuſe to treat with us, and are ſent down by him (as we hear) to gather hands to make new turmoils. Seeing that himſelf and his ſaid two Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents preſs the Introducing Extraordinary Authority, againſt both the laws of our Countrey, and the reſolution of her Majeſty, as alſo the ſenſe of our Reverend Aſſemblies and Conſults in regard of it's inſecurity and dangerouſneſſe to Catholicks. Seeing that, both againſt the Orders of ſeveral Popes and the unanimous ſenſe of our Aſſemblies and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, they preſſe the diſannulling the Chapter, ſo to reduce us to an Anarchy and Deſolation in the Vacancy of our Seat: Seeing that his whole courſe tends to oppoſe all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedures which are orderly, legal, charitable, and authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and, on the contrary, ſtill vehemently endeavouring to to carry things on by a violent hurry of paſſion, clamour and cenſure: Seeing (we ſay) that not conſidering himſelf but
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:108708:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>a private man, and as ſuch, of no Authority at all here, he ſo often hath and ſtill doth unrelentingly perſiſt to diſturb our publick peace by his illegall machinations, we held it our duty to give you notice at large of his many and manifold <hi>Schiſmatical</hi> proceedings, intreating you to ſatisfy all whom it may concern of the patience and charity we have us'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him ſo long time, and his unreaſonableneſſe and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durateneſſe in his <hi>Schiſm</hi> againſt us.

Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius (for as much, as in compliance with his paſtorall charge, he zealouſly endeuor'd to obſtruct the ſpreading of their pernicious do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines)
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:108708:25"/>expreſses therein, that this glorious Champion of the Catholick Church, being inform'd of ſundry wicked aſperſions, which the ſaid Arrians had craftily caſt vpon him, with deſign to take away his good name, euen amongſt his own Brethren, iudg'd it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to addreſſe an Apology vnto Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius the Emperour for the clearing of his innocency, leaſt by neglecting to publish truth, the wounds his integrity had receiu'd from ſlandering tongues migh grow wider, truth being the ſole cure, and ſoueraign re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt ſuch hurts.</p>
                  <p>After the example of this moſt illuſtrious Prelate, I haue thought it expedient to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to your ſacred Maieſtie an: Apology of the like nature, that is my owne defence, in Anſwer to an Army of affronts and calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which a wanton ſchollar, and his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents haue caſt vpon me: and (abſtracting from a ſpeciall ſupernaturall prouidence of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:108708:25"/>God, that guided the pen of S. Athanaſius in all his writings, and ſo made him a great Doctor of his Church) I haue greater motiues of aduantage to induce me to this preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, as to myne, then S. Athanaſius had, as to his Apology.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Conſtantius the Emperour was a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorer of the Arrians, and the ſole ſupport of their nouelle Sect: but y.<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> hath euer shewn a great abhorrence of all prophane nouelties, and an extream diſlike of each introduced cuſtome, that is not conform to the generall practice of the Church of God, and confirm'd from the Chaire of S. Peter.</p>
                  <p>Secondly I was the firſt Engliſh Prieſt, that was ſworn of your Ma.<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> Chapell, in conſequence of which, I do not beare the marke of a meer ſubiect onely, but of both ſubiect, and ſeruant: and ſince an iniuſtice done to a ſeruant, of neceſſity reflectes v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the maſter, or miſtris, whoſe ſeruant he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:108708:26"/>is, it follows by naturall inference, that I can challenge ſomething of right, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring to your Mâ.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> for protection in a iuſt cauſe; and truly if the defence I haue dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vp, shall appeare guilty of falſe dealing, then I will ceaſe from playing the Apologer, and become an humble Petitioner, that my name may be for euer blotted out of the liſt of your Ma.<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> ſeruants, and my ſelfe beare the infamous brand to all poſterity of being, as my Aduerſaries endeuour to make me, a very rogue.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly Conſtantius the Emperour was not onely a fauourer of the Arrian Clergy, but a perſecutour of S. Athanaſius, of whom that clergy had ſayd all mamer of euill. Contrariwiſe your Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> hath shewn kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes for me, far aboue any deſert of myne; I was committed Priſonner to Douer Caſtle, vpon ſuſpicion of being a Prieſt, and your Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> compaſſionating my vniuſt ſufferings,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:108708:26"/>obtain'd my deliuerance. Again being falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accuſed to principall Miniſters of our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te king of moſt happie memory, vnder the ſupport of your Ma.<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> protection, as to my Religion, I voluntarily appear'd at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil Table euen in a coniuncture of a violent ſtorme caſually rais'd againſt Prieſts, and was diſmiſſed with honour, nothing of euidence being produc'd, that could render me guilty of the leaſt medling, in order to affairs of ſtate; and indeed during your Ma.<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> ſtay in England you neuer protected Prieſt, or lay-Catholick otherwiſe, then with this prouiſo: <hi>If he has done nothing againſt the ſtate:</hi> your Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> knew right well that the ſupreme pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence had ſet bounds to euery vocation, ſoe that no man ought to put his ſickle on ſtrang ground. The office of a Prieſt is to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage onely what is his own, and Chriſts bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſ, and to leaue to Caeſar, and the wiſe Miniſters of his Council, a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Fourthly my greateſt Patron, whiles I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the English Miſſion, was that gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant perſon the R.<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Father Philip, Beloued of your Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> in a high meaſure, ſutable to his merits, for he executed his charge of Ghoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father with extream prudence, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd all his affairs with an admirable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct: b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:108708:27"/>were ſpread in France, and alſo when M.<hi rend="sup">r</hi> White, alias Blacloe began to publish his phanatick learning; and his ſenſe being required (at ſundry tymes my ſelfe preſent) in order to both of them, he alwais gaue the ſame anſwer, ſaying, that he was too ould to embrace any new Religion.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly I haue hazarded my life, and ſpent, not of my ſuperfluity, which I had not, but of my pouertie, what I had (after the imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the poor good woman that caſt into the Treaſury of Ieruſalem her two mites which were all her riches.) To ſerue our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te ſoueraign Lord your Ma.<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> Husband of moſt happie memory. The Church of God does not teach Catholicks to deſert their true, and lawfull Princes in their ſufferings, neither does their aduerſity leſſen the power they had in their proſperity to exact obedience from their ſubiects, but encreaſe it.</p>
                  <p>Now MADAME hauing ſet down the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:108708:28"/>principall motiues, which haue enbolden'd me to addreſſ an Apology to your Sacred Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> vnto clearing of my Innocency, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein I haue imitated the great Athanaſius: I haue an other part to play after the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the pious Mardocheus, whom the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme prouidence had put to rule ouer the Iews (the ſeed of Gods choſen people) which had been carryed away from Ieruſalem in the captiuity of Iechonias king of Iuda: This great ſeruant of God Mardocheus perceiuing that the wicked Haman, and his friends had a deſign to deſtroy them, made humble In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion to the glorious Queen Heſter for the preſeruation of the ſayd People of God, whoſe Religion she profeſſed. In like manner whereas M.<hi rend="sup">r</hi> White &amp; his Adherents menace the Colledge of Doway (whereof the ſupreme prouidence hatth conſtituted me, (though moſt vnworthy of the charge) principall Gouernour) which receaued the ſeede of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108708:28"/>that had been carryed away from England in the captiuity of Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion vnder the Reign of Queen Elizabeth. For the preſeruing of the ſaid ſeed after the example of the pious Mardocheus I haue thought it expedient to intercede to your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>, who doubtleſs is as glorious a Queen in the ſight of God, as was Queen Heſter, whom not onely you haue equal'd, as to profeſſing of the true faith, but ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed, as to the many ſufferings your Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> hath endured patiently vnto gaining a crown of Martirdome, and indeed according to our great Apoſtle S. Gregory true belieuers that ſuffer perſecution for iuſtice ſake patiently, and innocently, are Martyrs without effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of blood: and I am certain of your Ma.<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> vniuſt ſufferings, and more grieuous, I dare auerre, then euer Chriſtian Princeſs endured, Y.<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> haueing bin banishd wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, the king your Huſband barbarouſly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108708:29"/>murdered, the King your ſon in continuall danger of his Fathers murderers and in want of requiſits neceſſary to his Ma.<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Neither can I doubt, but that your Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> hath both patiently and innocently endured them, becauſe your moſt Religious Confeſſor himſelfe told me that he had heard your Generall Confeſſion twice, (once in eminent danger of death vpon the ſea going out of Holland, when the raging wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes threatned preſent ruine) and profeſſed, that he could neuer accuſe your Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> of one mortall ſin. Wherefore I intercede vnto your Sacred Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> not as to a glorious Queen onely, but as to God's Martyr alſo, for our poore Colledge, that hath preſeru'd the ſeed of Catholick Religion down from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Queen Elizabeths Reign till theſe preſent tymes. I intercede for a Colledge of Paſtours, ſo called in as much, as ſince it was founded by that moſt excellent Prelate D.<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:108708:29"/>Allan (who was the firſt Preſident, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fterwards Cardinal) and erected in Doway in the yeare of our Lord 1568. it hath ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue a Thouſand Paſtours into England for the miniſtry of that litle Church I interced for a Colledge of Martyrs, ſo named becauſe about a hundred and fortie of her Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Prieſts haue endured impriſonments, rack's, hyrdles, and at laſt shed their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blood in defence of the Church, the ſea Apoſtolick, and Catholick Faith; a glorious harueſt for ſo little ſeed, as came of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of Queen Maries dayes, that is of a few graue learned Prieſts vnder the conduct of D.<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Allan, which vnder the Reign of Queen Elizabeth left their goods and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments and came to Doway. I interced for the Mother-Houſe, ſo commonly ſtil'd in regard, as it was the firſt Seminary ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted according to the ordinance of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Trent, and a pattern of many others:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:108708:30"/>ſo it has been the mother of all our English Colledges in Rome, Spain, and S. Omers which it furnishd for a great tyme (that is vntill S.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108708:30"/>I intercede for a Colledge properly cal'd the ſpirituall Mother of all our English Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, for as much as before any other Community of our Nation ſent Miſſionaries into England, she had ſent about a hunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Prieſts, who with much labour, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of their blood brake the firſt Ice, and made the way for ſuch as came after.</p>
                  <p>MADAME, for my ſelfe I am an Apologer onely, but for our Mother-Houſe I am an Interceſſor, moſt humbly beſeeching your Sacred Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> to looke on her with a gracious eye, to the encouragement of your Catholick Subiects, and the diſcouragement of our few wanton Clergy-men of this pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick age, that endeuour to hurt her, ſince they cannot make her a plantation of their new notions. I cannot doubt of your Ma.<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> gracious fauour towards her, she hauing had formerly (about 22. yeares agoe) eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence enough of your Ma.<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> extream ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:108708:31"/>and compaſſion vnto conſeruing her, when ſhe was reduc'd vnto great neceſſity through warre, and peſtilence, wherewith as ſoon as your Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> was acquainted by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Philip, and the Right Hon.<hi rend="sup">ble</hi> Perſonage now your Ma.<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> great Almoner my Lord Abbot Montague (my ſelfe hauing mou'd them afore to that good worke) you were pleas'd to order conſiderable ſupplies for her releife. Likewiſe I intercede for her Clergy Children, that theſe through your Ma.<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> power may caſt away all phanatick nouelties, walke in the wayes of their glorious Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours, giue obedience where obedience is due, and loue one an other carefully ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoring to keepe vnitie of Spirit in the bond of peace, Eph. 4. And MADAME all this is faiſable enough, if your Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> shall conſtitute my L. Ab.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:108708:31"/>able to remedy what is amiſs, vnto preuenting of ſchiſm, that menace's the litle Church of your Catholick ſubiects. And as to my own perſon, if for my ſake the preſent tempeſt is come vpon our Mother-Houſe, and the Catholicks of England; ſo that they be ſau'd, caſt me into the ſea, that is thruſt me out of the Mother-Houſe, and banish me from my natiue Country (which was my offer to our wanton Brethren at my laſt beeing in England) and as I ſpeake this from my hart, ſo I will endure affliction gladly for ſo generall a good: a ſmall hole in any corner of a Catholick Commonwealth will ſerue to end the remnant of my dayes, and bring my aged head with comfort to the graue.

As it is no dishonour to be accuſed, ſince the beſt integrity, and innocency is ſubiect to that ſcandall: ſo it is an honour to be accuſed falsly: the vnchaſt Elders falſely accuſed the Chaſt Suſanna of incontinency, and the accuſation
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:108708:34"/>turn'd to her honour, <hi>Dan.</hi> 13. The wicked Ammon falſely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed the pious Mardochaeus of impiety, and he was exalted thereby Eſther. 8. nay the Ecceſiaſticall Annals of our Country afforde euidence enough of this aſſerted truth: for all Catholick poſterity celebrates with much reuerence the memories of S. Thomas Arch-Bishop of Canterbury, S. Wilfred Arch-Bishop of Yorke, and bleſſed Iohn Fisher Bishop of Rocheſter, for their godly, and Religious enterpriſes, notwithſtanding, that in the purſuance thereof, they were reſiſted, falſely accuſed, and iniured by their own Clergy reſpectiuely, and at different tymes.</p>
                  <p>Again I am nothing trubl'd, becauſe I know right well, that as it is naturall vnto a ſerpent to hiſs, vnto a ſcorpion to ſtinge, and vnto a Dragon to breath foorth poiſon: ſo is it vſual, and familiar to wanton ſchollars, that are ambicious to vent new notions, and become Authors of new ſects, as likewiſe to their adherents, to reuile, and ſay all manner of euil againſt ſuch, as reſiſte them in the purſuance of their pernicious enterpriſes: for example the Pelagians, againſt S. Auſtin; louinians againſt S. Hierome, the Arrians againſt S. Athanaſius sharpened their wicked, and ſlandering tongues: the poiſon of Adders is vnder the lipps of ſuch ſingular Teachers, which trauell after plantations of new notions, as a woman that is about to bring forth a Child: and carried away with their own luſts, breath out of their mouths Venemous calumnies to the leſſning, and hurting of ſuch as piouſly, and religiouſely endenoure to obſtruct their wicked deſigns: howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer innocency is a wall of braſs inuincible: <hi>Gaude</hi> (ſays the great Dr. S.

The firſt happened ſoon after I engaged in the management of our old mother's affairs, for one halfe yeare was hardly expired, when I was ſummon'd to encounter with a litle army of falſe accuſations (forged by Mr. Blacloe, and his adherents) and exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited againſt me to the Nuncio of Bruſſels vnto whoſe iuriſdiction I was ſubiect: and his lordship after diligent inquiſition, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture examination of my anſweres to all the ſaid accuſations, was euidently conuinc'd of the inordinate proceeding, vſed by my Aduerſaries: in ſo much, that he was pleaſd to call the aſperſions caſt vpon me, the Bowes of the wicked, and ſtyled, my Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries malicious men, as appeareth by his ſaid lordships letter written to my ſelfe, which although I haue inſerted formerly in my declaratory Epiſtle in anſwer to Mr. Blacloes printed ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies againſt me, neuertheles I haue thought fitting to ſet down in this my Encyclicall Anſwer, and it is, as followeth.</p>

                  <p>Which giue euidence enough, in order to this conflict, of my victory and my aduerſaries shame.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond victory I obtained at my laſt being at london <hi>Octob.</hi> 1660. which happened thus. Sr. Kenelme Digby Mr. Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloes Maecenas, accuſed me to our Queens grand Almener, the Lord Abbot Muntegue in the preſence of Mr. Car, that I had inform'd the Hon. Mr. Secretary Moris, that there was come ouer a Ball of books (Mr. Blacloes ſtatera morum) directed to Mr. Holland (Secretary of the Chapter) vnder the name of Smith, and likewiſe that I had told his Honour that it was a worke of dangerous conſequence as to the State, and therefore required a warrant to intercept the ſaid booke: alſo that I had acquainted his Honour, Mr. Secretary with priuate affairs concerning Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks: again that I had intercepted his to the Chapters Secretary, and the Chapters Secretary Letters to him, and opened them. After Sr. Kenelme had finish'd this formidable charge, my Lord Almener aſked of him, if what he related were certainé? certaine, replyed Sr. Kenelme; my Lord: I come now from Secretary Moris, who told it me. The next day my Lord grand Almener acquainted me with the aforeſaid charge, and giuing credence to what Sr. Kenelme had vttered, ſeemd much trubled, that I should carrie my ſelfe ſo vnhandſomely, as to that proceeding: I made Anſwere ſaying ſurely Sr. Kenelme will neuer atteſte ſuch a paſſage, and Father it vpon me; ſurely replyed his lordship, he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:108708:35"/>hath atteſted it: and being a matter of fact, it is eaſely prou'd, or diſprou'd; to which I anſwered, ſaying, tis very true, and therefore beſeech'd his lordship, that Sr. Kenelme, and my ſelfe might meet, and diſpute this buſines face to face; his lordship approued my propoſition, and promiſed to goe with me to Sr. Kenelme. In the meane while I aſſured his lordship in the word of a Chriſtian, and a Prieſt, that neither had I euer ſpoken with, nor been in the company of his H<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Secretary Moris; neither had I euer made addreſſes vnto him directly, or indirecty: neither had I euer in all the courſe of my life intercepted, or opened any letters, or Letter directed to Sr. Kenelme, or his friend Mr. Holland, Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of the Chapter. This my proteſtation amazed the grand Almener, in ſo much that his lordship told me that of neceſſity I ought to go to Sr. Kenelme. In the interim, his lordship meeting with, ſaid vnto him: Sr. Kenelme doubt leſſe there is a miſtake, as to the information you gaue me againſt Dr. Leyburn, for he will depoſe, that he neuer ſpoke with Secretary Moris, or euer made addreſſes vnto him: he knowes not the man &amp;c. Sr. Kenelm replyed in theſe words (as my lord Almener told my own ſelfe) truly I confeſs, Secretary Moris did not name Dr. Leyburn, but I gathered from the Secretaryes words, that Dr. Leyburne had ſo inform'd him. Thus I carried the ſecond Victory.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding all this I am informed that Sr. Kenelme, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuing me to be the perſon, that eſpecially obſtructe's the ſpreading of the Digbean Theology, according to his wonted manner at Paris, and after the imitation of his all knowing maſter Mr. Blacloe (who in a printed letter calleth Dr. Leyburn ſycophant, madman, hiſſing ſerpent, calumniatour, ſylly, and ignorant man) brandeth me at London with the names of periur'd man, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danticall foole: which contumelious ſpeeches without proofe do not beſeem him, neither as he is a meer man, nor as he is a Gentleman, nor as he is a knight, nor as he is in outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, a Catholick. There is parity between me and Sr. Kenelme in all theſe degrees: for as to human nature, he is no more man
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:108708:36"/>then myſelfe vpon that ſcoare. There is parity as to Gentility, becauſe when William the conquerour inuaded England, there was a Sr. Roger Leyburn of Conſwick in weſtmoreland (as appeareth by the Records of Durham) which is the ancient houſe of the Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burns, (whereof now actually my own Brother is ſeigneur) and ſo hath continued from Generation, to generation <hi>vnſold:</hi> The laſt knight of Conſwich was Sr. Nicholas Leyburn Father to the Ducheſs of norfolke, whoſe name was Elizabeth Leyburn mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the old Counteſſe of Arundell and Grand mother of the earle of Arundell that now is: and likewiſe Father to the Lady Howard of Noward in Cumberland, and to the lady Munteagle of Hornby Caſtle in lancashire. And if we will peruſe the Records of Douer Caſtle (which Sr. Edward Dyring shewd vnto my ſelfe when I was his Priſonner there) we shall finde that my Anceſters haue perform'd, as good, and faithfull ſeruice to their ſoueraign Princes, as perhaps Sr. Kenelm's family hath done. But tis true, that in the Reign of Queen Elizabeth our family loſt great fortunes for mayntaining the old Religion, which it neuer <hi>Changed.</hi> This doth euidence enough, that there may be parity bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ween Sr. Kenelme Digby and myſelfe as to Gentility: and I am certain that there is parity, as to knightship, for as much as I am a Dr. of Diuinity. Again there is parity, as to Catholick, becauſe I am a Catholick Prieſt, and Sr. Kenelme is but <hi>at the moſt</hi> a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick layman, howeuer I will ſay with S. Hierome, <hi>Gratias ago Deo meo, quod ſim dignus, quem oderint homines, quoniam illi magis, quam his ſtudeo placere.</hi> Moreuer I will ſay to Sir Kenelm, what S. Auſtin ſaid afore to his Aduerſary a manichaean, <hi>Sentide</hi> (Ley burno) <hi>quicquid libet, ſola me in oculis Dei conſcientia non accuſet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third victory was got thus: being come to london I was inform'd, that my Chapter Aduerſaries there had perſwaded ſundry of our Brethren, how in my laſt great ſicknes I had an intent to giue our College away from the Clergy. Which was onely a crafty enterpriſe of the ſaid Aduerſaries to render me more odious to all my Brethren, for the report was ſo falſe, that as God beſt know's,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108708:36"/>I had no thought of any ſuch deſign. Beſides it was no more in my power to diſpoſe of Dow: College, then it was withim my reach the laſt ſummer to hinder Mr. Holland, the Chapter Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary, from his Secret iournay to Roterdame, where he continued about two months with Mr. Blacloe, that then was printing his <hi>Statera morum:</hi> Or preuent Dr. Ellis, and other Chapter men from reporting, that their Secretary Mr. Holland was in one, or other County of England, when he was in the Town of Roter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame. Furthermore, as ſoon as I perceiued that my Phiſitians diſpai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of my recouery, I called vnto me the ſeniors, and Counſelled them to thinke of ſome one, that might ſucceed in my roome, as likewiſe to the end a perſon named by them might finde ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of aduantage by my recommendation, I ſigned two blancks with my own hands for letters to the Pope, and Cardinall Francis Barbarin, our Protector, and Ordered Mr. Edward Robinſon Profeſſor of Diuinity (who will atteſt as much) to write the ſaid letters: Moreouer being deſired by the ſaid Seniors to nominate my Succeſſor, I anſwered, that I should aduiſe them to make choice of D. Ellis: ſuch was the opinion I had of him then.</p>
                  <p>After the gaining of theſe three notable victories as to vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my integrity, no man as to reaſon could haue imagined, but that I might haue been freed of my Aduerſaries calumnies for the future: notwithſtanding I finde too true in our age what S. Bernard <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>De conſiderat. C.</hi> 10. obſerued in his dayes, <hi>Alius inoleuit mos, dies alij ſunt, &amp; alij hominum mores, &amp; tempora periculoſa non inſtant iam, ſed extant: fraus &amp; circumuentio &amp; violentia inualuere ſuper terram. Calumuiatores multi, defenſor rarus.</hi> And indeed, as to my owne particular I dare with confidence ſay, that in this preſent age <hi>falſi accuſatores ſunt multi,</hi> to witt <hi>Dr. Ellis, Mr. Curtis,</hi> and ſeuen more (which <hi>M. Blacloe</hi> in his laſt booke names the Clergy of London and they call themſelues the Church of the Catholick Clergy) who haue put forth an Encyclicall Epiſtle filled with many ſeando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous aſperſions which they caſt vpon me, vnto wounding my honour, and reputation, as by my Encyclicall Anſwer will appeare, or
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108708:37"/>otherwiſe let me fall in the iudgements of all my Brethren, and lay Catholicks of England. Wherefore in purſuance of my deſign, as to the conſeruing of my good name, I will take my riſe from theſe words of the ſaid Epiſtle <hi>About the yeare</hi> 1648. <hi>Dr. Leyb: was ſent in to England by my lord Vicar Generall in ſolidum.</hi> Which Dr. Ellis Mr. Curtis &amp;c. ſet down in the 2. page of their Encyclicall Epiſtle, and shall furnith a fit occaſion to forme a Preamble narratiue (afore my engagement in order to a ſpeciall clearing of my ſelfe) to shew how firſt of all diſſention, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion crept into our Clergy, as likewiſe how I came to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſted with the Eccleſiaſticall Dignity of Vicar Generall.</p>
                  <p>As to theſe two poynts, tis obſeruable, that about the yeare 1628. I was conſtituted Sole Agent, as to the outward management of all affairs pertaining to our Bishop, his Clergy, and our old Mother: and ſo continued till about the yeare 1642. during vvhich ſpace of yeares, and long afore, our Clergy extreamely florished, and enioy'd fulnes of peace amongſt them ſelues, and perfect vnion vvith their old Mother, whoſe affairs were then managed by that gallant perſon D. Kelliſon, <hi>(Cuius memoria in benedictione eſt.)</hi> and during the tyme of my Agentship the ſupreme prouidence ſo proſpered Dr. Louell, (who was an excellent Clergy man) and my owne endeuours, that, in order to the Clergy's conſeruation, we perſwaded the ancient Prieſts, and others to contribute conſiderable ſum's for the erecting of a fund vnto aſſiſting and relieuing ſuch Brethren, as might be either deſtitute of Reſidences, or otherwiſe brought to neceſſity. Alſo in order to our old Mother my owne particular endeuours were crown'd with ſucceſs, as appeares by Dr. Kelliſons laſt will, and teſtament, which containe theſe expreſs words written with his owne hand, Viz: <hi>I giue to Mr. George Leyburn who hath been a great friend, and Benefactour to me, and this Houſe, my beſt Ring, and Iewell, and what elſe my Executours shall thinke fit to beſtowe on him, for he deſerueth more then I am able to giue.</hi> In like manner my lord Bishop by his lordships laſt will, left vnto me his god pectorall Croſſe, and conſiderable Charities to this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:108708:37"/>But about the yeares 1638, 39, 40. dyed all the moſt eminent Clergy men, namely <hi>Dr. Kelliſon, Dr. Stratford, Dean Bennet, Dean Collington, Dr. Louell, Dr. Shell, Mr. Broughton, Mr: Troloppe, Mr. Rogers,</hi> to geather with Sundry other Chapter men of great Zeale, prudence, and eminency, who euen in the tyme of thoſe afore mentioned yeares reſpectiuely, begun to perceaue Mr. Blacloes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to prophane nouellties, and therefore extreamely disliked him, but eſpecially Dr. Kelliſon, Dr. Stratford, D. Louell, Mr. Muſket. and my lord Bishop who ſuruiued the other four to publiſh his diſlike and reſiſte the pernicious doctrines ſet foorth by him which afore he had taught in priuate onely:<note place="margin">Wheras Mr. Blacklo about the yeare 1633. had vnaduiſedly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued a certain booke that contained ſundry new notions, that diſedifyed many lay Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks and the Clergy Generally, my lord Bishop, Dr. Kelliſon, Dr. Stratford, Dr. Louell, M.

Which he obſtinately refuſed.</note> and indeed his Iordship was wont to ſay to me, and others whom I can name, that he had the two marks of an Heretick, to wit <hi>Singularity, and nouelty:</hi> and for my own part I had ſo great an abhorrence of his wicked opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, euen afore they were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in print, that as his Adherenrs cryed them vp, I contrariwiſe cryed them down. <hi>Et hinc illae lacrymae:</hi> that is the ſole ground of the grieuous perſecution which as to calumnies, I haue endured leſs, or more, for the ſpace of 18. yeares: but about the yeare 1642. conſidering ſeriouſely with my ſelfe the great diſtempers then beginning in our Country, the abſence of our Paſtour, the miſs of Dr. Kelliſon, Dr. Stratford, D. Louell, &amp;c. the chief ancient heads of our Clergy, and our new Deans aduancing of Mr. Blacloes Adherents, I reſolud to retire out of England, follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing the example of S. Gregory Nazyanzen, who perceauing that, the great labours which he had exerciſed in his Epiſcopall charge at Conſtinople for the bringing of ſouls out of ſin, and hereſy, had brought a mighty <hi>Odium</hi> vpon him ſelfe, the Arrian Bishops,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:108708:38"/>enuying extreamely the happie ſucceſs he had in his godly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes, quitred euen his Bishoprick, conceiuing, that it would not ly in his power to ouercome his potent Aduerſaries, and imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that by his abſence they might the ſooner be brought to reaſon, or at leaſt be appeaſed therby: which indeed was my imagination in order to Mr. Blacloe and his Adherents. Wherefore after I had acquainted our Dean, that was not verſed in our affairs (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing not been in England in 40. yeares afore) as likewiſe Mr. Gage who principally directed him in the gouernement of his Charge, with the end for which the fund was erected, and with the monyes entruſted with Mr. Blacloe, I deliuered vp all my offices, and ſteer'd my courſe for France, with deſign to ſpend the reſt of my dayes in ſome obſcure corner of the world: but being to paſs by Paris, my duty obliged me to waite vpon my lord Bishop, thorough whoſe earneſt perſuaſions, I engaged in the ſeruice of Turnay College for the ſpace of two yeares. In the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim, came to Paris Sr. Kenelme Digby, Mr. Blacloe, Mr. Fitton, and Mr. Harrington, Dr. Holden was there afore, and then (togeather with Ianſeniſme) Digbean Blacloiſme begun to be taught euen to laymen and women, before it came forth in print, which was an occaſion of continuall diſputes; my lord Bishop shew'd an extreame diſlike of Mr. Blacloes nouellties, and as to me, after my wonted manner I endeuoured to crush them in the bud, and cry them down as often as I heard them mentioned: which rendered me more vngrattfull vnto Sr. Kenelme, Dr. Holden, Mr. Fitton, Mr. Harrington, and Mr. Car they all being great Admirers of Mr. Blacloes Learning. Yet as to Mr. Fitton, he about the yeare 1636. being brought to the point of death by a redeous Sicknes, deliuered all Mr. Blacloes books, which were then put foorth to the Inquiſitour of florence shewing his diſlike of the Tenets therein conteyned: and foretelling, that they would be condemned, if they were not already: as the Hon. Mr. Henry Sommerſet, and Dr. Kitton (Mr. Fittons executeurs) haue atteſted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:108708:38"/>About the yeare 1645. hauing finish'd the tyme of my enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement, as to the ſeruing of Turnay College, I humbly requeſted my lord Bishop for his leaue to departe from that employment, and euen from the Towne of Paris; his lordship refuſed to grant my requeſt: telling me in plain tearms, that he would not truſt the ſaid College with Mr. Fitton, nor with any other except myſelfe: Mr. Clifford hauing afore quitted his principalship. Howeuer after two, or three bouts, I quieted my lord, and obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his lordships condeſcention to my departure, on condition to returne, when his lordship should lay his commands vpon me.</p>
                  <p>Thus being freed of my engagement, and thereby deliuered from the ſight of my Aduerſaries, that lookt vpon me with an enuious eye, in reguarde they ſaw, that I went about to obſtruct the ſpreading of Mr. Blacloes new doctrines, I retired from Paris to Rhemes in Champaign, where I had not continued aboue three months, but my lord Bishop ſent me an expreſs order ſignifyed in two ſeuerall letters, to bring me again to Paris, becauſe our Queen was newly arriued out of England, and had oppointed Sr. Kenelme Digbie as Agent to his Holines, and intimated with all, that he in reſpect of his great abilities, her Mai. countenance, and the great kindnes he had for Mr. Blacloe, Mr. Fitton, Dr. Holden, &amp;c. might extreamely aduantage our Clergy. In obedience to his lordships commands I return'd, and ſuddenly after my arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall, a conſult was held in my lord Bish: chamber, conſiſting of his lordship, Mr. Fitton (newly conſtituted Dean) Mr. Clifford. Dr. Holden, Mr. Blacloe, Mr. Car, and my ſelfe. The ſole buſines, that Mr. Dean propounded at this meeting, was the Seaſonablenes (in reguard of Sr. Kenelme's Agentship) for our Clergy to ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Pope vnto obtaining of his Holines approbation, and confirmation of our Chapter, and therefore required that letters might be expedited togeather with a commiſſion to impower Sr. Kenelme, with authoritie vnto negotiating in behalfe of the Clergy: which accordingly was performd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being carryed by plurality of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:108708:39"/>votes; and indeed I was, againſt mouing in the Court of Rome for a confirmation thereof (and onely his lordship voted with me) alleaging as a reaſon, that we had continued in poſſeſſion of Eccleſiaſticall dignities (conſtituted by his lordship, and his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor) for a conſiderable ſeries of yeares, without any ſentence pronounced by the Court of Rome vnto the diſannulling of them, and if we shall ſtill ſo continue, it will be a great motiue to his Holines (whoſoeuer is Pope) to continue vnto vs a Bishop, which is the happines we deſire onely: but if our motion for the confirmation thereof, ſayd I, were reiected, where as now we build on the tacite conſent of his Holines, as to the confirmation of the ſayd Eccleſiaſticall dignities, we should then wholly deſtroy the ground on which we build. The ſucceſſe Sr. Kenelm Digbie had in the purſuance of that negotiation I will not tell for ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>About the yeare 1648. Dean Fitton in complyance to his charge, and in conſideration of the tymes that begun to be more calme, and moderate vnder the Gouernement of a new maſter, reſolued to go into England, and at the ſame tyme my lord Bishop was deſired to conſtitute Mr. Harrington his Vicar Gen. <hi>In ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum;</hi> where fore his lordship after a ſerious deliberation with himſelfe (as he told me) thinking it inconuenient that the ſole principall men of his Chapter should conſiſte of Mr. Blacloes Adherents, whereby nouelties might be countenanced to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice of our body, and others alſo, called me vnto him, and ſayd, that he had made choice of me for his Vicar Generall, and therefore deſired, I would prepare my ſelfe to go ſuddenly into England. But I refuſed abſolutely the charge, alleadging that the acceptance thereof might bring me to my graue, with continuall vexations, Mr. Blacloe and his faction (that would beare cheef rule in the Chapter) looking on me with an enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous eye. To this, his lordship replyed, ſaying, my deſire is to obſtruct the ſpreading of new Doctrines, in our Country, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore you muſt not refuſe euen to ſuffer inconueniences for ſo
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:108708:39"/>good, and laudable an end, and thereby it shall appeare that I am an Enimy to all prophane nouelties. In ſum his lordships great earneſtneſs preuailed with me ſo far, as I promiſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ſeriouſly, and commend to God his lordships propoſall, and to this end, and purpoſe I exacted 7. dayes reſpite, before I might bring my Anſwere, which was granted me: and as God is my witnes, in each one of thoſe dayes, I frequented places of greateſt deuotion, and ſuch eſpecially as had the B. Sacrament expoſed, beſeeching the diuine goodnes to direct me, as to the Anſwere I was to giue. The ſeauen dayes being expired, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to his lordship, who inſtantly asking of me what I had reſolued, my replye was in theſe words; <hi>Qui vos audit me audit, qui vos ſpernit me ſpernit:</hi> The will of my ſuperior muſt be Gods will, and therefore reſolued to do it, although I should encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with Armyes of troubles in the performance thereof. My lord Bish. hauing thus obtained my conſent, cauſed a patent to be drawne, writte two letters himſelfe, one to our Chapter men, an other to the Hon. Mr. Mountague who is now our Queens great Almener, and ſo diſpatcht me away ſuddenly without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting Mr. Fitton, Dr. Holden, Mr. Blacloe, or Mr. Car. But as ſoon as theſe vnderſtood, that I was arriued at london, and conſtituted his lordships Vicar Generall, vnto excluding of Mr. Harrington (Mr. Blacloes principall Diſciple) they were ſtarteled, yet perceiuing no remedy, there being an impoſſibility to vndoe my lord Bish. owne Act, betooke them ſelues to crafty dealings. For vnder a ſpecious colour of greater vnion they much importun'd his lordship to create Mr. Harrington a ſecond Vicar Gen. <hi>In ſolidum,</hi> that his power might equall myne: and in the purſuance of their importunity they employed the endeuours of all ſuch (men, and women) as they were ſure, his lordship had a ſpeciall kindnes for; in ſo much that his lordship wrought vpon by their importunity, and carried on with the ſpecious pretext of eſtablishing greater vnion, by creating Mr. Harrington a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Vicar Generall, he yeelded. Thus hauing gained a great
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:108708:40"/>aduantage againſt me they belieued (as they had reaſon) that my authority would be ſo ecclipſed thereby, that it should ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie nothing in the Chapter, the principall members thereof (which were a pack of Mr. Blacloes friends) hauing obtained a Vicar Gen. of their own faction, inueſted into equall power, and iuriſdiction with my ſelfe. Howeuer mens Propoſals, and Gods direction do not alwais agree: and ſuch as too much attend their own ambitious ends, ſeldome confine themſelues to Gods pleaſure, and means, as plainely appeared by the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly endeuours they vſed to incenſe my lord Bishop againſt me, and to leſſen my reputation in the opinion of all our Brethren. For the ſupreame prouidence that did not leaue Ioſeph in his priſon, nor Danyel in his Denne, did not deſert me in the perſecution theſe men craftely by vvicked Calumnies raiſed to the obſcuring of my good name for my power with my lord Bish. my credit with the Lay-Catholicks in Generall, and my authority with our Brethren, ſuch eſpecially as were no London Chapter-men encreaſd thereby, while I remained in England. But I dare ſay that Mr. Blacloe, and his faction perſecuted me as violently, and Calumniated me as craftely, as the Arrians did S. Athanaſius.</p>
                  <p>From the premiſes does euidently appeare the florishing cofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our Clergy as to good ſeed, that was ſown in the field of their harts, till <hi>Homo inimicus</hi> came, <hi>qui ſuper ſeminauit zizania diſcordiae, &amp; haereſis.</hi> Thus much as to shewing the manner how diuiſion crept into our Clergy, and the means whereby the dignity, or office of grand Vicar <hi>in ſolidum,</hi> was conferred on me; and although theſe ſole paſſages ſet down were ſufficient enough to defeat my Aduerſaries, as to the particular aſperſions, they caſt vpon me: neuertheleſs that they may not brag hereafter, as if I had return'd them but a lame Anſwere.</p>

                     <hi>PAg.</hi> 2. Of the Encyclicall Epiſtle. <hi>In Auguſt following</hi> (1648) <hi>there was held a generall Chapter in which preſided Mr. Fitton our Dean.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:108708:40"/>The Chapter-men from all their diſtricts being met, Dr. Leyb. (againſt the known order, and rules of ſuch meetings) bringes thither without the Deans notice two others, which were not of the Chapter. Mr. Dean ciuilly told them.—VVhereupon they retired one of them was ſatiſfyed, the other vow'd reuenge. — VVhich (Chapter) was ended with much ſatiſfaction to all others except Dr. Leyb.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This firſt charge, for as much, as it obiectes ſcandalous matters and proues nothing thereof, carrieth the infamous marke of a ſlander, for <hi>Accuſatio, quae caret probatione, calumnia eſt:</hi> and indeed, if to accuſe were ſufficient enough to take away a mans good name, innocency could not be deliuered from the malice of ſlandering tongues: In conſequence of which I am not bound to Anſwere. Howeuer ſince the accuſation comes from Dr. Ellis, Mr. Curtis &amp;c. whoſe bare Teſtimonies may haue ſomething of weight, and authority, therefore I haue thought it expedient to cleare each particular poynt of the ſayd Charge.</p>
                  <p>As to the firſt, that obiecteth tranſgreſſion againſt the known order, and rules of ſuch meetings, for bringing thither two of our Brethren, which vvere not of the Chapter: I replye to this pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorian Teſtimony (which is <hi>Dictum proprium</hi> named by Ariſtotle <hi>Argumentum ſtultorum</hi>) that inuolues two falſe ſuppoſals: whereof the one is, that there were known order, and rules vnto exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſuch Brethren from a generall Aſſembly, as were not of the Chapter: for afore any of my Accuſers were <hi>Clerici</hi> (except Mr. Curtis, and Mr. Plat my ſcholler) I was in all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults and generall meetings of our Clergy, and in thoſe it was the vſe, and cuſtome to inuite thither ſuch graue, and deſeruing Brethren as accidentally came to London, in the tyme of the ſaid meetings, although they were no Chapter-men; the intent whereof was to do them honour in reſpect of their great merits. The other falſe ſuppoſall is, as to our two Brethren which Dr. Ellis &amp;c. ſay, I brought vnto the afore mentioned generall Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly: truly I did onely ſummon them in vertue of my lord Bishop his owne letter, wherein his Lordship expreſſed that he
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:108708:41"/>had conſtituted both of them Canons, and the letter I shewd to the Dean euen while he vnciuilly, and diſobediently diſmiſs'd them before the Aſſembly begun to ſit; and hence aroſe the firſt diſpute between the Dean and my ſelfe. I produced his Lordships letter whereby the two foreſaid Brethren were conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Chapter-men, and complained of the Deans inciuility, and diſobedience, but he pretended that his Lordship had giuen him leaue to make ſuch a number of Canons: and accordingly had compleated it: withall added, that it was not in his Lordships power to encreaſe the ſaid number. Whereunto I replyed, that ſurely the power of a Bishop to make Chapter-men more or leſſe, as he pleaſeth, is not exhauſted by making thirty, whereas afore he might haue created thirty two, vnleſs he had tyed his hands to a <hi>Non plus vltra,</hi> which Mr. Dean could not euince.</p>
                  <p>But this was not the ſole conteſt between me, and the Dean in that Aſſembly (as they ſay) for he, and Dr. Holden eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially had compoſed a ſmall booke of rules, and conſtitutions to be obſerued by the Chapter. Theſe the Dean read in our firſt ſeſſion, and after the reading thereof required approbation and confirmation of them: I reſiſted this requeſt, alleadging that they contained ſundry points deſtructiue of my lord Bishops Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall authority, and inſtanced principally in one particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, that exacted obedience to the Chapter, from all Clergy Prieſts of England, and Wales: and this I carried againſt the Dean, and his party, the Aſſembly refuſing to paſs it without their Bishops condeſcention vnto it. Likewiſe I inſtanced in an other conſtitution, that required an oath from all Chapter-men, obliging them not to reueale paſſages, and tranſactions done in the Chapter, to any perſons, or perſon whoſeouer. I perceiuing, that Mr. Blacloes Adherents intended thereby to keepe his Lordship from the knowledge of affairs, ſtood vp, and ſaid, that I excepted againſt the particle, <hi>VVhoſoeuer,</hi> alleadging, that it might beare no good meaning, and withall told the Dean plainely, that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:108708:41"/>I should refuſe to take an oath vnto excluding my lord B. from the knowledge of his Chapters proceedings. This netled extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely the Dean, and that party; howeuer being put to votes, I carried it, and in the oath of ſecrecy, that my ſelfe, and the reſt of the Aſſemby then tooke, his Lordship was excepted: and truly I acquainted my lord immediately with theſe paſſages, who as God is my witnes, writte back vnto me, as to the rules, and conſtitutions, Mr. Fitton, and Dr. Holden had shewn them vnto him, and that he had ſignifyed, for as much as he had read, his diſlike of them: and as to exhibiting obedience to the Chapter he commanded me to prohibite in his name the execution thereof. Notwithſtanding after the diſſolution of the Aſſemby, Mr. Blacloes Adherents continued in the purſuance of their deſign, as to exhibiting obedience to the Chapter, in ſo much that my lord Bishop threatned to depriue them of their faculties if they should not ſuddenly deſiſte from that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize.</p>
                  <p>As to the ſecond point of the charge; that is of moment, to wit, <hi>The other vow'd reuenge.</hi> By this pythagorian Teſtimony without proofe; euidently appeares, that Dr. Ellis, M. Curtis &amp;c. do not sharpen their ſlandering tongues againſt me onely, but likewiſe againſt all ſuch, as shew a diſlike of Mr. Blacloes Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and theſe mens proceedings in the countenancing thereof. For I dare boldly auerre, that the worthy Party, Whom they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe of vow'd reuenge, is guilty of no other ſin in order to them, or their affairs, then his diſlike &amp;c. He is a perſon that I haue known for the ſpace of aboue 40. yeares, he tooke the degree of Licentiat, and performd all Acts required to the creating of him Dr. in the ſchools of Sorbon, when Dr. Ellis was a meer youth: he hath laudably laboured in the Apoſtolicall miſſion about 30. yeares without reproche: he hath had euer an extream abhorrence of ſuch actions as beſeem not Prieſts, namely, going to playes, hanting of Alehouſes and Tauerns, playing the ſolicitour, traffic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out of a deſire of wordly aduantages; alſo he hath had
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108708:42"/>euer a great kindnes for Dr. Ellis, whom he had known a young youth of modeſt behauiour, and hath giuen him much good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe, and Counſell, at his entring into his office of Deanship, and ſince; which if he had embraced, he would neuer haue ſo vncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably abuſed the preſident of Dow. Coll: that is to ſay, his Father, (that College being his old Mother) by putting forth vnaduiſedly an Encyclicall Epiſtle, wherein, he accuſeth the ſaid Preſident of ſundry grieuous crimes, and extolleth aboue the clouds the ſaid Mr. Blacloe for his gallant parts, his <hi>vnimpeachable vertue, vmblemisht life,</hi> and <hi>eminent learning,</hi> which vnparalelled Elogium to the euerlaſting dishonour of our Clergy Mr. Blacloe hath published in Latin as followeth.</p>
                  <p>De me Cleri Londinatis Encyclica ad Fratres per Vniuerſam Angliam Epiſtola, hoc teſtimonium continet. <hi>Quantum ad Albij</hi> (alio nomine, quo notus ſum Fratribus, me appellat) <hi>Perſonam attinet, nouimus eam ſemper vitae irreprehenſibilis &amp; exemplaris conuictûs fuiſſe, &amp; propterea ex Regulis Chriſtianae pietatis tenemur eam aeſtimare &amp; honorare: Plura inſignia munera Cleri authoritate geſſit, totidem egregia ſeruitia Clero rependit.

                  <p>As to the third point, or third pythagorian Teſtimony, that is, <hi>Proprium dictum</hi> without proofe, Viz: <hi>which</hi> (Chapter Aug: 1648.) <hi>was ended with much ſatisfaction to all others except Mr. Leyb.;</hi> there will be no great need to replye, becauſe the premiſes ſet down doe clearely shew, that to the extreame diſſatiſfaction of Mr. Blacloes friends, I obſtructed the confirmation of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, that exacted obedience to the Chapter from all Clergy Prieſts: as likewiſe I preuailed ſo, as to the oath of Secrecy, that it was taken in that Aſſembly without excluding my lord Bish: from the knowledge of the Chapter's proceedings, and tranſactions. Again, as God is my witnes, ſundry members of that Aſſembly
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:108708:42"/>told me in expreſs words, that it was a Parliamentary Chapter, for, ſaid they, as the parliament hath depriued their king of his whole power, ſo the Chapter goes about to take away their Bishops authority: which does euidence that it <hi>ended</hi> not <hi>with much ſatisfaction to all others, except Mr. Leyb.</hi> Wherefore the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of this, and the other two replyes clearely verifie the ſaying of the great Dr. S. Chryſoſtome: <hi>Non modo nullum incommoduns ijs, qui perferunt infidias, verum etiam, id omne in caput inſidiantium conuertitur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Pag. 4. <hi>A generall Chapter met Iuly</hi> 10. 1653. <hi>but Dr. Leyb. and his friend, who had vow'd reuenge formerly, effected that my lord ſent his mandate to diſſolue the Aſſembly, as met to out him from his Epiſcopall authority &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this, as in the former Charge Dr. Ellis, Mr. Curtis &amp;c. imitate pythagoras, as to their Teſtimony, which is <hi>Dictum pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prium</hi> onely; they produce no conuincing reaſons to proue what they aſſert: neither indeed can they alleadge any, the ſaid charge conſiſting of two moſt falſe propoſitions the Latter whereof is, that <hi>my lord</hi> Bish. <hi>ſent his mandate to diſſolue the Aſſembly</hi> (Iuly 1653.) <hi>as met to out him</hi> from his Epiſcopall authority. The other is: <hi>That Dr. Leyh. and his freind effected the ſending of the ſaid Mandate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the latter propoſition ſet down in the firſt place, in regard of my lord, that is thereby concern'd, I do proue, that it hath nothing of truth, thus: His Lordship neuer harboured ſuch a thought, as to belieue, that the Aſſembly was met to machinate againſt his Epiſcopall authority: <hi>Ergo</hi> his Lordship did not ſend his mandate to diſſolue the Aſſembly, as met to out him from his Epicopall authority. The conſequence is good, and the Antecedent, from whence I infer it, euidently appeares by my lord's Anſwere to Mr. <hi>Harrington,</hi> Mr. <hi>Harriſon, alias Herbere,</hi> Mr. <hi>Knightly,</hi> Mr. <hi>VValton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ashton, &amp;</hi> Mr. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſon,</hi> alias <hi>Curtis</hi> writ Aug. 1653. after that Aſſembly was ended: and is as followeth.</p>

                        <p>I <hi>Haue receiued your letter dated the</hi> 1. <hi>Aug. in which you grieuouſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accuſe me (to repeat your own words) to haue condemned by a publick Inſtrument your late Aſſembly, and therin all the Prieſts of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, and VVales repreſented by them, as ingratefully, and ſeditiouſly machinating againſt my Epiſcopall authority, without hearing any one of you: and you earneſtly require me to recall the ſaid condemnation vnder my hand, and ſeale for reparation of your good name.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>To which I Anſwer</hi> 1. <hi>that you proue not at all your ſaid accuſation of me; and yow know well, that accuſation without proofe is a meere ſlander, and none should be innocent,</hi> Si accuſaſſe ſufficiat. <hi>Secondly I proteſt ſincerely, that I neuer meant to condemne the late Aſſembly, and much leſs, all the Prieſts of England, and VVales of vngratefull, and ſeditious machinating againſt my Epiſcopall authority. Thirdly I ſay, that though becauſe you be my Accuſers herein, the whole burden of proofe lyeth vpon you, and I ought to be acquitted, if you conuince not your ſayd accuſation: yet becauſe my Innocency herein is Clear, I will proue it out of my Mandate, in which you ſay, I haue condemned your Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and all Prieſts of England, and VVales. Firſt by the word</hi> Ingratè, <hi>which can no way be meant of your Aſſembly, becauſe I neither gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifyed, nor obliged them any way, and therefore they could not be thought to deale vngratefully againſt me. Secondly by the word</hi> Seditioſè, <hi>which is ioyned to the words,</hi> Convocaſti preſbiteros, <hi>and the Aſſembly did not conuocate, but was conuocated. Thirdly by the whole Mandate, which conſiſteth of two partes: in the former whereof, are thoſe words,</hi> Ingratè &amp; ſeditioſè, <hi>in which I ſpeake onely to Mr. Harrington, as is euident by theſe words:</hi> Quoniam (vt à fide dignis accepimus) Tu Marce Vicarie mi Generalis, nuper ingratè &amp; ſeditioſè con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocaſti quoſdam preſbiteros ſaeculares &amp;c. <hi>And in the ſecond part which beginneth:</hi> Et ſimiliter praecipimus omnibus preſbiteris à te nuper convocatis &amp;c. <hi>In which I ſpeake to the Aſſembly, there

Thus Clearly, and manifeſtly I haue prou'd my Innocency, as concerning the foreſaid condemnation of your Aſſembly, and of all Prieſts in England, and VVales: ſo that, I need not produce (as you require)</hi> Teſtes fide dignos <hi>to proue that condemnation to be iuſt: But you need bring conuincing reaſons out of my Mandate to proue, that I made any ſuch condemnation, if you will shew Yr. ſelues to be lawfull Accuſers of your Spirituall Father, and Superior; likewiſe I need not recall vnder my hand, and ſeal, what I neuer ſaid, or thought, but you are bound vnder your hands to recall what you haue plainly, but vntruly impoſed vpon me: and that shall ſuffice me for reparation of my honour, and credit, which ought to be as much (if not more) deare to me, as yours to you, for I attribute your errour herein, not to malice, or ill will againſt me, but to a ſimple miſtake of my meaning vpon vnſufficient conſideration of my words: As for proceeding iuridically, which you ſay, I haue refuſed to two or three: I vſed it, at my firſt comming into England, but I found not, that it wrought any good effect, and therefore left it; and indeed iudge that it is not fit for theſe tymes in England: neither do. I think you would take it well, if I should force you to a iuridicall proof of your foreſaid accuſation againſt me; what I wrote lately to Mr. VValton, that he had ſatiſfyed me concerning the Aſſembly, that therin nothing was done againſt my Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall authoritie, which before I ſuſpected: but not that the Aſſembly had vngratfully, and ſeditiouſely machinated againſt my Epiſcopall authority, which I neuer ſuſpected, nor euer imagined till I read this your letter. You call Mr. Harrington Sub Dean of Yr. Chapter, which office I neuer gaue him, nor any other, that had authority from me. Is not this to vſurpe vpon Epiſcopall authority, and to take Spirituall authoritie giuen by none? VVhich what offence it is, you well know.</hi>

                           <hi>I haue receaued yours of the</hi> 31. <hi>of October, and much maruelled to ſee a letter of that ſubiect from your ſelf, becauſe you are not intereſſed in the quarrel of the fiue Prieſts, for whom you plead, and haue enough to doe for your own works, as alſo becauſe they needed not your help, and as you confeſs,</hi> A treatie of accomodation between me, and them, is ſet on foot, <hi>which perhaps your letter may hinder. You ſay, you will not eſpouſe their quarrel, and yet you doe it in the chiefeſt point, and therin ſpend two third parts of your letter, and endeauour to proue, that this conſequence is good;</hi> If Mr. Metham (Harrington) were condemned as ſeditiouſly conuocating the Aſſemble, the Aſſemble it ſelf was condemned as ſeditiouſly conuocated, <hi>Becauſe, forſooth, where there is an actiue, there is a paſſiue, as if there were no more but an actiue, and paſſiue: but if you looke well, you will here find two actiues, to wit, two condemnations, the former, of Mr. Metham: the latter, of the Aſſemble, and the latter I ſay wil not follow of the former: whicht I proued both by the example of the Apoſtles, whom we condemn not in anie ſort of ſedition, though we condemn the Iews therof, in conuocating them, which example you touch not: and alſo by reaſon, becaus the conuocated may nether know, nor conſent to the ſeditious intent of the Conuocator, and without knowledg and conſent, there is no ſin at all, and conſequently no cauſe of condemnation: and this I tooke to be the ſtate of the Aſſembly conuocated by Mr. Metham. But ſay you, if the conuocation be illegall, the conuocated are faultie in yealding to an illegall action. I anſwer, the conuocation it ſelf may be legall, becaus according to law, and by lawfull authoritie, and yet the intention of the Conuocator, illegall and ſeditious, for a good deed may be done for an ill end, and one may know and conſert to the good deed, and yet nether know nor conſent to the ill end, for which it is done. But you replie, that the Aſſembly could not be ignorant, of what themſelues did. True, but yet they might be ignorant of the intent of him who procured them to doe what they did. Nether wil it follow, that if I feared they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:108708:44"/>did ſomething preiudicial to my authoritie, that therefore I ſuſpected them of ſedition againſt my authoritie, becauſe they might be perſwaded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that either that was not againſt my authoritie indeed, or if it were, they had iuſt cauſe to doe it. For example, the Councel of Conſtance acted againſt the Papal authoritie of three Popes, yet were not guiltie of ſedition againſt Papal authoritie, becauſe they were perſwaded that what they did, was iuſt and neceſſarie for the good of the Church. And it is</hi> Sedition, <hi>which I am charged to haue imputed to the Aſſembly, and to all the Prieſts in England, and VVales, and is that, which I denie, and you should proue, but of which I neuer ſuſpected the Aſſembly.</hi>

                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:108708:46"/>after the imitation of that worthy Arch Deacon Mr. T. B. now liuing, to whom Mr. Gage, and Mr. Curtis, at my comming into England, had communicated the deſign of outing my lord Bish: and of the courſe they intended to ſteer for the effecting it; The vertuous perſon after he was departed from them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting vpon his duty, office, and oath, came to my chamber, who was his Lordship Vic: Gen: in ſolidum, and reuealed what Mr. Gage, and Mr. Curtis had imparted vnto him in ſecret. wherefore I told him, that he was bound to make a certificate thereof, ſigne with his own hand, and ſend it to his Lordship: which was done accordingly. Afterwards Mr. Gage, and Mr. Curtis being inform'd from Paris that his Lordship was extreamly offended with their machinating againſt him, they replyed to the Informer, that the good Arch-Deacon ought not to be credited, becauſe he was (ſaid they) a perſon much addicted to the Ieſuits, thinking to diſcredite his Teſtimony thereby. But his Lordship writ vnto me after the arriuall of this information, that Mr. Tho. B. inclination to the Ieſuits was not a ſufficient ground to inualide his Teſtimony, ſo that his Lordships iuſt wrath continued, and they put to new inuentions, vnto appeaſing him: wherefore they made their addreſſes to Mr. T. B. himſelfe, ſignifying that the Teſtimony, he had giuen, would of neceſſity cauſe great diſtractions, and diuiſions in the Clergy: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vrgd him to moderate it in ſuch a fashion at leaſt as his Lordship might haue ſome grownd to thinke that their meaning and intent, as to the words of the ſaid Teſtimony, might bear no ſound of a rebellious deſign, which thorough their impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, and his own vertue, and piety (that deſired vnity in our body though with the leſſening of his own honour) he moderated accordingly. But after he had done ſo, they vanted, that he had recal'd his ſaid Teſtimony. I belieue that, after the ſame manner Mr. Harriſon, alias Herbert delt with the other afore mentioned: wherefore tis probable that Dr. Ellis &amp;c. make vſe of the piety and pitty shew'd towards Mr. Herbert to reuenge themſelues of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:108708:46"/>that pious, and vertuous perſon, in regard he is counted an enemy to Mr. Blacloe, and his Adherents; for truly what he relates of Mr. Herbert in his letter I do eaſily belieue, becauſe Mr. Herbert, (whom I preferred to the beſt Reſidence of England) tol'd me to my face, that he ſaw no reaſon, why that man should be our Superior, who neuer came among vs; and after my arriuall in the low Country's he writ vnto me, that it was not Hon. to oppoſe Mr. Blacloes Doctrines, who had been my Maſter; to which I replyed, that I had onely ſtudyed his writings in the firſt book of phyſicks, for the ſpace of about 3. monets, till Dr. Stratford returnd from Paris; howeuer I added, that I preferred my Spirituall Father, and Superiors Counſells which were, that we should abhorre prophane nouelties, before a million of maſters, that should be carryed about with euery wind of Doctrine. Thirdly my lord Bishop in a letter dated after the breaking vp of the Aſſembly Iuly 1653 (I haue shewn it to our Seniors) writeth thus: Mr. Lancaſter telleth me that Mr. Page (a vertuous Prieſt, and Arch-Deacon) vpon his deaths Bed told him that, <hi>the intent of the pack</hi> (ſo Mr. Blacloes Adherents were named) <hi>in the laſt meeting was to cry vp Mr. Blacloes Doctrines, and ouerthrowe my authority, which (authority) Mr. Car ſaid lately to my face was imaginary, and this, I aſſure myſelfe, he ſaid not of him ſelfe alone: ſo they can make vſe for themſelues of an authority, which they account imaginary.</hi> And indeed Mr. Blacloe held it for ſuch, as appeares by a letter, he writ to the Nuncio of Paris, which is ſet down in my declaratory Epiſtle published 1656. he dares not now deny the letter, though his Paris friends made him once diſclaime from it, and perſuaded my lord Bish. that it was compoſed by our Aduerſaries vnto fomenting of diſſentions.</p>
                  <p>As to the other propoſition, to wit, <hi>Dr. Leyb. and his friend, that vowd reuenge, effected that my Lord ſent his Maudate.</hi> To this I replye, that it is ſo falſe, that as God beſt knows, I had no ſuch intent; howeuer Dr. Ellis, Mr. Curtis &amp;c. to perſuade our Brethren, that I was an efficient cauſe of the ſaid Mandate they
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:108708:47"/>dreſs vp a proofe with darke words, and ſentences, knowing well that if they had ſpoken plainely, I should haue diſcouered their crafty dealing as plainely. The proofe (ſuch as it is) they ſet down pag 4. thus Mr. <hi>Leyb. friend gaue vnder his hand, that the letter he writt him, to ſend my lord, was altered in one part of it, and that himſelfe feigned the reſt, to ſee how they who preath patience, and Charity to others, could endure a wrong done themſelues. They are his own words in his own hand yet extant. Now this altered letter paſſing through Dr. Leyb. hand to my lord, my lord expreſſing that he had it a Perſonis fide dignis, Dr. Leyb. writing at the ſame tyme to my lord, and encloſing his friends letter, vpon the receipt of which two letters, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately iſſued the Mandate: tis no hard matter to perceiue plainely who was ioyn'd with that misinformer, and ſo made my lord expreſs them plurally.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the proofe, it is a mere ſtory cut out of a phanatick brain that hath nothing of ſenſe or reaſon. For 1. Dr. Ellis, and Mr. Curtis &amp;c. auerre, that Mr. Leyb. friend writte him a letter to ſend to my Lord: but Mr. Leyb. proteſteth that he had no order from his friend to ſend any letter to my lord that friend writt at any tyme. Secondly they auerre that the letter writte to Mr. Leyb. was altered in one part of it: but they do not ſpecifie in what, it was altered. Thirdly they put in a different character: <hi>To ſee how they, who preach patience and Charity to others, could endure a wrong done themſelues;</hi> and immediately followeth theſe particles expreſſed in the ordinarie character, <hi>They are his owne words in his own hand yet extant.</hi> Here I was extreamely troubled to conceiue whether the immediate, written in a different, or the precedent words expreſſed in the ordinary character ought to be meant, <hi>By his own words in his own hand yet extant:</hi> Neither as yet can I pick vp the meaning thereof. Fourthly they auerre that the altered letter paſſed through Mr. Leyb. hand to my lord; but they do not mention by whom, or whether afore, or after the receipt thereof it was altered. If they had meant aright without deſign to abuſe our Brethren they would haue ſet down
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108708:47"/>the letter, and declared plainely in what part thereof, and by whom the alteration was made. But they durſt not do ſo, for they know well, that though their great ſupport at Paris inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the originall, neuertheles there is an authenticall copie in being ſubſcribed by two Prieſts. Whereby appeareth that the ſaid letter was vvritten to my own ſelfe, and not to my lord, neither was I aduiſed to ſend it his Lordſhip. Howeuer I doe confidently belieue, that the foreſaid friend, what he did, was out of tender compaſſion towards Mr. Harriſon, to the end, he might be reconciled to my lord Bishop, leaſt his nephew then his Lordships Secretary might ſuffer preiudice thereby: and I am certain that meer pitry mou'd the aboue mentioned Arch-Deacon to qualify and moderate his Certificate. But tis not a Prieſt-like action to ſlander a worthy Brother for performing an act of Charity to the leſſening of his own honour. Fiſtly they auerre that my lord Bish: in his Mandate ſaid (<hi>Vt à perſonis fide dignis</hi>) plurally, becauſe I ſent the letter to his Lordship; whereby they do moſt petulantly accuſe their Bishop of manifeſt ignorance as to the Churches canons which require two teſtimonies to the conſtituting of <hi>Perſonas fide dignas,</hi> in matter of debate: but he that ſends one ſole Teſtimony, or the meſſenger that carrieth it does not make two witneſſes: and as God know's beſt, I ſent to my lord my friends letter writ to myſelfe onely. Again the letter ſent was dated 23. Iune 1653. <hi>Stilo veteri,</hi> and I am ſure, that his Lordships receiu'd a copie thereof about the 2. of Iuly, and the original intercepted was ſent 6. weeks after at leaſt, whereby plainely appeareth, that Dr. Ellis &amp;c. ſpeak vnaduiſedly, in ſaying, that vpon the receipt of that letter iſſued the <hi>Mandate,</hi> ſeing that the Aſſembly began to ſitt Iuly 10. 1653. and hereby further appeareth that there was neither ſence, nor reaſon to accuſe me of being an efficient cauſe of my Lords <hi>Mandat.</hi> Beſides, the ample Teſtimonies which I haue produced to the manifeſting Mr. Blacloes parties intent to inuade my lords Epiſcopall authority in that Aſſembly) do euidence enough, that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:108708:48"/>his Lordship might heare of that deſign a <hi>Perſonis ſide dignis</hi> wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout the helpe of my friends letter. Wherefore let Dr. Ellis &amp;c. make better vſe for the future of the holy Churches prayer ſet down before the preface of the maſs. <hi>Pone Domine cuſtodiam ori meo, &amp; oſtium circonſtantiae labijs meis: vt non declinet cor meum in verba malitiae ad excuſandas excuſationes in peccatis.</hi>

                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 5. <hi>Mr. Leyb. in his letter to Mr. Peterſon vtterly diſauow'd euer writing to Mr. Harrington, or ſending miſſionaries to him, or of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating with him, or Mr. Blacloe; and this was after my Lord (as appeares by his letters to Mr. VValton) was ſo ſorry for the iniury he had done Mr. Harrington that he kept correſpondence with him to his dying day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Charge hath two branches, vvhereof one importes my refuſing to vvrite or ſend miſſionaries to Mr. Harrington; the other expreſſeth my Lord Bishops ſorrow for hauing iniured the ſame Mr. Harrington. As to the firſt, though I am confident that the words, as they are dreſſed vp neuer came, from my pen, howeuer it matters not, as to the poynt in debate. For I do grant vnto Dr. Ellis, Mr. Curtis &amp;c. that I refuſed to ſend miſſionaries to Mr. Harrington, and I had great reaſon ſo to carrie my ſelfe, becauſe I knew well that he vvas carried away wholly with Mr. Blacloes pernicious and blaſphemous Doctrines, obſtinately maintaining them to my face in the preſence of Lay-Catholicks, at ſundry tymes; wherefore I thought my ſelfe bound both as to reaſon, and conſcience neither to entertaine a familiarity with him (that being againſt the Apoſtles Counſell and the Churches canons) nor committe my children to his direction, and inſtruction for that might bring their ſoules to euerlaſting ruine. Again by doing ſo I should haue trangreſſed the law of God and nature; theſe exacting from a Superior care, and vigilance to the conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of himſelfe, and ſuch as are committed to his Charge. I haue thought it expedient not to particulariſe here the pernicious Doctrines, but to to reſerue the naming of them for my anſwere to Mr. Blacloes <hi>Vnimpeacable vertue, vnblemisht life,</hi> and <hi>moſt eminent,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:108708:48"/>learning,</hi> vvhich are the illuſtrious Characters Dr. Ellis, Mr. Curtis, togeather vvith 7. other Canons (which name them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues the Church of the English Clergy) haue Canonically giuen him.</p>
                  <p>As to the other branch, that imporees my Lord Bish. expreſſing of his ſorrow for hauing iniured Mr. Harrington &amp;c. Here Dr. Ellis, Mr. Curtis &amp;c. after their vvonted manner bring nothing of proofe; but as pythagoras required from his ſchollars, ſo they exacte from their Brethren credence to their <hi>Propria dicta.</hi> Yet I perceiue that they vvould willingly haue our ſaid Brethren imagine, that Mr. Waltons letters carried ſome ſound that vvay, and therefore they shut within a parentheſis theſe particles (as appeares by Mr. Waltons letters) ſo as that they may relate to the precedent, vnto ſignifying the tyme of my refuſing to ſend miſſionaries to Mr. Harrington, or to the ſubſequent words, vnto teſtifying my lords ſorrow for the iniury done Mr. Harrington, This in earneſt is crafty dealing: but doubtleſs if in their eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence boxes any letters were extant, that might expreſs this aſperſion, vvhich they Caſt vpon our moſt R. B. they would haue ſet them down vvith an <hi>Io Triumphe.</hi> But if his Lordship expreſſed ſorrow for iniuring Mr. Harrington: of neceſſity it was either in order to the <hi>Mandate,</hi> that calleth Mr. Harrington ingrate, and ſeditious, beginning thus. <hi>Quoniam vt à fide dignis ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepimus, Tu Marce (Harrington) Vicarie mi Generalis ingratè, &amp; ſeditioſè conuocaſti &amp;c.</hi> Or in order to his Lordships Anſwere written to the ſix Prieſts, Viz, Marke Harrington, William Harriſon, Andrew Knightly, ſames Walton, Thomas Ashton, and Peter Peterſon, alias Curtis. Wherein his Lordship expreſſeth him ſelfe thus in order to Mr. Harrington. <hi>You call Mr. Harrington Sub-Dean of Yr. Chapter, which office I neuer gaue him, nor any other, who had authority from me. Is not this to vſurpe vpon Epiſcopall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and to take Spirituall authoritie giuen by none? which, what offence it is, you well know:</hi> Or laſtly in order to my lord Bish. his Anſwere written to a letter to fiue of the fore mentioned Prieſts,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:108708:49"/>Viz: Mr. Harrington, William Harriſon, Peter Peterſon, Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Ashton, Andrew Knightly, wherein, as to Mr. Harrington, his Lordship ſays thus: <hi>And as for Mr. Harringtons Sub-Deanship, I Anſwere that I neuer conſtituted ſuch an office, nor would make him Sub-Dean, though Mr. Fitton did deſire me, nor euer aſſuredly knew, that he euer vſurped ſuch an office, till I read Yr. firſt letter: wherefore I commande him to giue it ouer, till he shew me, both that Mr. Fitton had authoritie to make him Sub Dean and legally made him ſuch Pacem &amp; veritatein diligite, &amp; Deus pacis crit vobiſcum Farewell,</hi> 11. Oct. 1653. Now if Mr. Dr. Ellis, Mr Curtis &amp;c. can demonſtrate that his Lordship euer recalled his Mandate, as to acknowledging of wrong done Mr. Harrington, or his vvords expreſſed in order to Mr. Harrington in either of his foreſaid letters, then I shall belieue, that my lord was ſorry for the iniury done M. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington: In the meane vvhile am certaine that 3. of the ſix Prieſts, Viz: Mr. Knightly, Mr. Ashton, and Mr. Walton ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and gaue full ſatisfaction to his Lordship without ſtanding out. Beſides (though a good while after) Mr. Harriſon (by the helpe of my friend, who is accuſed ſeuerall tymes in the Encyclicall letter of vowing reuenge) made his peace with my lord, through an humble ſubmiſſion in ſo much that his Lordship immediately after, vvrit vnto me in theſe very words. New <hi>Mr. Harriſon, and I am friends: vvherefore I deſire that you tvvo vvill be friends alſo.</hi> But of Mr. Harrington, or Mr. Curtis ſubmiſſion, and reconciliation I neuer heard. I vvill end now with the exclamation, that St. Policarpe vſed in the tyme of his perſecution. <hi>Deus bone, ad quae tempora nos reſeruaſti?</hi> A company of 9. Prieſts brand a moſt R.

                  <p>Here Dr. Ellis, Mr. Curtis &amp;c. after their wonted manner endeuour to render me odious to all my Brethren accuſing me for hauing calumniated the whole Aſſembly of 1653. but ſince they do not proue the calumnie, it follow's of neceſſity, that they haue calumniated me, <hi>(Accuſatio quae caret probatione calumnia eſt)</hi> and indeed ſo they haue; for the aſperſion they Caſt vpon me is ſo falſe, that as God know's beſt it neuer came into my thought to conceiue amiſs of that whole Aſſembly, either in order to the inuading my Lords Epiſcopall Authoritie, or preiudicing our old Mother-Houſe committed to my charge; notwithſtanding I knew well, that Mr. Blacloes faction had conſpired againſt each of both. And as to their deſign againſt my lords Epiſcopall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, the ample Teſtimonies afore mentioned proue euidently enough their conſpiracy: likewiſe, as to myſelfe, and our Mother-Houſe, they had laid their plot to ruine vs, before that Aſſembly began to ſitt. For Mr. Foſter ſent me a letter about that tyme (I haue communicated it to our Seniors) which containes theſe expreſs words. <hi>I had a ſight of the propoſition; ere the Aſſembly met<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one of them vvas, that all legacies that should be left to your Houſe, at the inſtance of any one, or more of the Clergy, should be by them diſpos'd of tovvards the maintainance of vvell diſpos'd youths of each County to be brought vp in Yr. Houſe, and thence being qualifyed to returne to their Country, Yr. Houſe not being to medle therein, as alſo that none should be ſent ouer, but ſuch as had ended their ſtudies. This was vvhat I ſavv before the Aſſembly met. I was inuited diuers tymes by the Prime of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> (Mr. Harrington) <hi>yet I neuer did go, that ſo by my abſence I might teſtify the diſlike I had of a propoſition deſtructiue, I thought, to the good of our Mother-Houſe.</hi> Beſides our North Country Chapter-men,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108708:50"/>men, that ſat in the ſaid Aſſembly, namely Mr. Ashton, and Mr. Young, togeather with ſome others, writ vnto me how valiantly they had carried themſelues in behalfe of their old Mother. As God know's beſt I miſtruſted not at all that Aſſembly, though I knew that all the Grandees, that is the principall members thereof, vvere Mr. Blacloes Adherents: Nay albeit that Mr. Blacloe hath much ſtrengthned himſelfe ſince the conuening of the ſaid Aſſembly, and my Lord Bish: death, for as much as he has new Chapter-men created, which are according to his own hart: for example Dr. Ellis. Mr. Plot, Mr. Manly, Mr. Singleton, Mr. Cancefield; neuertheleſs, if now a generall Aſſembly of Chapter-men were to be called I should not apprehend preiudice as to our Mother-Houſe thereby, becauſe I am confident, that there would be called vnto it ſundry conſcientious, pious, zealous, and well affected perſons to their old Mother, and myſelfe, that might hinder Mr. Blacloe, and his partys machinations and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly enterpriſes as to our preiudice. And notwithſtanding that this diſaffected party may imagine, that they haue vndone both of vs by their Encyclicall Epiſtle, howeuer I do not doubt, but that our old Mother shall receiue benefit, and my ſelfe honour thereby, whiles they beare the infamous brand to all poſterity, of being vngratefull <hi>(&amp; ingratum ſi dixeris, omnia ſcelera dixeris)</hi> for Dr. Ellis vvas an <hi>Alumnus</hi> of our Mother-Houſe, Mr. Plot had all his breeding in it, was my ſchollar about 3. yeares, and beſides I mou'd Dr. Kelliſon to receiue him for nothing. Mr. Iohn med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calſe, and Mr. Iohn Singleton were like wiſe <hi>Alumni,</hi> and the firſt amongſt our yorkeſhire Brethren, that haue caſt dirt in the face of their old Mother: in like manner Mr. Manly, and Mr. Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cefield the firſt amongſt our Brethren of Lancaſhire, that haue committed ſuch an impiety. Hereby appeares euidently how vnad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſedly, and vnhappily theſe few of our Brethren haue dreſſed vp this charge againſt me. But whereas in the cloſe thereof they craftily exhorte our Brethren to put in execution Mr. Blacloes former deſign, as to diſpoſing of Charities giuen to this Mother-Houſe,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:108708:50"/>Saying. <hi>VVe leaue to Yr. vviſedomes to iudge — vvhether it may not now be firt to put that point in execution,</hi> Mou'd thereby out of a tender care for the conſeruing of the Mother-Houſe, and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing her children, from prophane nouelties, I haue iudgd it expedient to haue recourſe to all our English Catholicks, vnto preuenting of their vngodly enterpriſes.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 7. <hi>Dr. Leyb. ſent a letter to Mr. Knightly, vvherein vvas ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed, that Mr. Blacloe made vs odious to all Chriſtian Princes, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine therein contained, touching them, as much as the king of ſcots</hi> (as he tearm'd his Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>) <hi>that his booke of Obedience, and Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement is againſt the Protector Cromvvell &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this Charge Dr. Ellis, Mr. Curtis &amp;c. imitate the crafty fi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sherman who loues to fish in troubled water, for thinking to make ſome aduantage againſt me by the ſaid letter, they haue troubled, tranſplaced, and confounded the words thereof; though not ſo much, but that I shall be able to eſcape their nets: for they do not conceale the chiefe ſubſtance. And indeed I do acknowledge that I writ to Mr. Knightly a letter wherein I ſignifyed, that Mr. Blacloes Doctrine, contained in his booke of <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Gouernement,</hi> made vs odious to all Chriſtian Princes, and was as much againſt Cromwell (then kinging it) as againſt the king of ſcots and ſo I called his Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>; this I am certaine was the ſubſtance, and the words where with my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries charge me importe as much. But it ſeem's to me a ſtrange thing, that Dr. Fllis, Mr. Curtis &amp;c should dare to object vnto me the abhorrence I haue from the Doctrine contained in Mr. Blacloes booke of Obedience and Gouernement (cut out of Mr. Hob's leuiathan) rendring the English Clergy odious to all Chriſtian Princes; ſince Mr. Tho. White, alias Blacloe in the ſaid booke of Obed. and Gouer. writeth thus, 1. Pag. 133. <hi>If a Magiſtrate hath truly deſerued to be, and is diſpoſſeſſed, euery one to his povver is bound to reſiſt him.</hi> Secondly Pag. 135. <hi>If a Magiſtrate be innocent, and vvrongfully diſpoſſeſſed, he is obliged abſolutely to renounce all right, and claime to gouernement: and if he does not, he is vvorſe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:108708:51"/>then an infidell.</hi> Thirdly pag. 147. <hi>Any, vvho hath ſuffered wrong by a Monarch, when he is diſpoſſeſsed may proceed as if there were no Commonwealth, by the lavv, vvhich in a wildernes warranteth vs to kill a Tyger or Robber, that ſeeketh to kill vs, not pretending lavv, for our action, but that it is manlike, and rationall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ground, or foundation on which he ſeem's to build theſe his horrid, Vnparalleld, Vnauthorized, and Vnchriſtian Tenets, is laid afore pag. 38. <hi>It follow's not</hi> (ſays Mr. Blacloe) <hi>that I wrong him</hi> (an other man) <hi>euen though I do him harme, or ſecke his ruine for he is no othervviſe to me, then a piece of cloath or wood, which I cut, and ſhape after my own will, fittingly for my vſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I name the Doctrines ſet down <hi>Horrid,</hi> becauſe no reaſonable man can read them without being horrour-ſtruck: <hi>Vnparalleld,</hi> becauſe no writer Chriſtian or Heathen hath euer broachd the like: <hi>Vnauthorized,</hi> becauſe Mr. Blacloe can not shew that he is ſent to teach them, and miſſion to teach and preach the Apoſtle requireth, Rom. 10. <hi>Quomodo praedicabunt, niſi mittantur:</hi> Laſtly I name them <hi>Vnchriſtian Tenets,</hi> becauſe the Doctrine of the Apoſtles on whom Chriſtian Religion was built, beare not the leaſt ſound that way. For example Rom. 13. <hi>Let euery ſoul be ſubiect to the higher powers; for there is no power but of God, whoſoeuer therefore refiſteth the power reſiſteth the ordinance of God, and they that reſiſt shall receiue to themſelues damnation — wherefore ye muſt be ſubiect not in regard of wrath onely, but alſo for conſcience ſake.</hi> Which ſcripture-Teſtimony does euidence plainely, that ſubiects shall receiue to themſelues damnation, if they take away from their Prince his Royall authority: and thoſe are to receiue greater damnation that wrong, hurt, reſiſt, or kill him ſo depriued, becauſe he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours, though by force of Armes, to be reſtored to his iuſt rights. Again 1. pet. 2. ſubiects are commanded to obey not onely good and curteous, but alſo froward Princes; and as a king that is diſpoſſeſſed by his own ſubiects, by the law of God and nature continues their king: ſo the diſpoſſeſſers of him continue his ſubiects, in conſequence of which, they, vnder penalty of euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:108708:51"/>damnation, are bound, not onely not to wrong him ſo diſpoſſeſt, but to Cheriſh, obey, honour, and reſtore him to his former power, and authority.</p>
                  <p>Hereby tis euidently manifeſt that Dr. Ellis, Mr. Curtis &amp;c. haue nothing of reaſon, or aduantage againſt me by their charge in order to Mr. Blacloes booke of obedience, and gouernement, vvhich I dare ſay vvas Odious to Cromwell himſelfe, though the Author, and the party that put him vpon that worke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued that they might haue gaynd him thereby vnto giuing them power to giue laws to all the Catholicks of England. But ſuch, as attend their own ambition, vvorke without Gods means, and direction. For Cromwell conceipted himſelfe to be as great a Magiſtrate, and Monarch, as any other whoſoeuer, and vvhen he was inform'd (as I haue heard) Mr. Blacloe taught in his book, <hi>That to do harme vnto, or ſeeke the ruine of an other, was not to wrong him &amp;c and likewiſe, that it was manlike, and rationall, for any that had ſuffered vvrong by a Monarch to proceede (when he is diſpoſſeſſed) as if there were no Commonvvealth, by the lavv, vvhich in a wildernes vvarranteth vs to kill a Tyger or Robber, that ſeeketh to kill vs;</hi> Therefore Cromwell mou'd with theſe reaſons ſet light by the ſaid booke.</p>
                  <p>But laſtly Dr. Ellis, Mr. Curtis &amp;c. accuſe me of calling our gratious Soueraign <hi>King of the ſcots;</hi> to which I replye that very vnaduiſedly they caſt that as an aſperſion vpon me, becauſe in their Encyclicall Epiſtle they extoll Mr. Blacloe for his eminent Doctrine which vvas plainely deſtructiue of his Ma.<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> perſon; for if a man will iudge by Mr. Blacloes Tenets ſet down, he would haue made our king Charles no king at all; howeuer his Ma.<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> own ſeruants durſt not giue him a greater Title then the king of ſcots, in their letters writt into England. Moreouer I am ſo vvell known to his Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> and his principall Miniſters of ſtate, that it will not lie within the reach of Mr. Blacloe, and all his Adherents, to preiudice me in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of our gracious Soueraign, for whom I haue hazarded my
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:108708:52"/>life, and ſpent my little fortunes in his Ma.<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> ſeruice.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore Dr. Ellis &amp;c. out of the fore-mentioned letter of mine to Mr. Knightly obiect againſt me thus. <hi>He (Mr. Leyb.) belieues not, Mr. Plantin (our Agent) vvill ſay that his Holines, or the Card. Protectour any wayes approued the Chapter, Dean, or Sub-Dean.</hi> To this I replye, that at my laſt being at London I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred vvith Mr. Plantin, as to this point, and enquired whether the Pope vſed the vvord <hi>Approho (I approue)</hi> and he anſwered onely, that hauing Audience of the Pope in the nick of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture he demanded of his Holines, how the Clergy might be gouerned till a Succeſſor vvere conſtituted: whereto vvas replyed this meer Quere: <hi>Nunquid habetis Capitulum, Decanum, Sub-Decanum?</hi> without naming the word <hi>Approbo, I approue:</hi> wherby appeares, that I did no wrong, by ſaying, that I will not belieue, that Mr. Plantin, our Agent &amp;c. But perhaps Dr. Ellis, Mr. Curtis &amp;c. will replye, that the Quere, <hi>Nunquid habetis &amp;c.</hi> imported appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation: <hi>Tranſeat,</hi> which is to ſay the interpretation is admitted, though not granted; and I am certain, it cannot be clearely infer'd from his Holines Quere. But then perhaps it may be demanded whether his Holines ſo interrogating Mr. Plantin, meant of a Collegiate or Cathedrall Chapter, for it might be in the power of our Bishop to moulde, fashon, and make ready either of both for his Holines confirmation; now how this queſtion can be decided out of, <hi>Nunquid habetis Capitulum, Decanum &amp;c.</hi> I do not conceiue; wherefore I told Mr. Plantin that he should haue humbly beſeech'd his Holines to declare his will, and pleaſure in writing, as to the exerciſing of luriſdiction, till a Succeſſor might be conſtituted, becauſe the ſaluation of ſouls dependes thereof. And truly if the Chapters Dean haue not power to giue faculties, and notwithſtanding giue them he committeth a grieuous Sin; for the Councell of Trent ſeſs. 14 defines, <hi>Nullius eſſe momenti eam abſolutionem quam Sacerdos profert in cum, in quem nee ord narians vel delegatam habet iuriſdictionem:</hi> Again though the Pope did approue the Chapter by ſaying. <hi>Nunquid habe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>s Capitulum &amp;c</hi> it
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:108708:52"/>will not appeare thereby that he inueſted the Dean with Epiſcopall authority vnto making him an <hi>Ordinarius;</hi> wherefore if my Counſell might haue been heard, nether Dr. Ellis nor the Chapter had exerciſed Epiſcopall authority without his Holines leaue expreſſed in a Breue. For immediately after the death of our Bish. I ſent a letter to Mr. Knightly his Lordships Vic. Gen. wishing him to aduiſe our Brethren pertaining to the Chapter to make addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſuddenly to his Holines for a Succeſſor and for the <hi>Interim,</hi> to deſiſt from the aſſuming of Epiſcopall iuriſdiction (as the Chapter did at the death of his Lordships predeceſſour) the exerciſe whereof might beget a iealouſy in the Court of Rome, that they were reſolu'd to make their Chapter a Bishop in effect, whether the Pope gaue them a Succeſſour, or not: Two other reaſons more I alleadged; the one was, that I knew well that my lord Bish. who was verſed in the Canons of the Church, did not belieue, that the Chapter (which after the imitation of his Predeceſſour, he had moulded, fashoned, and put in readines for his Holines confirmation) ought to ſucceed in Epiſcopall authority, without the Creation of a Succeſſour, or confirmation from his ſaid Holines; for as God know's beſt, his Lordship ſenſible of his great age, commanded me <hi>To giue to our Chief and moſt deſeruing. Brethren extra-ordinary faculties, telling me with all, that be did not thinke that after his death, ſuch faculties would be ſuddenly obtained.</hi> The ſame power and command his Lordship gaue to our Hon. Brother Mr. Clifford. In complyance to this commande I empowrd ſundry of our principall Brethren whereof Dr. Ellis, was one (but <hi>Delegatus non poteſt delegare</hi>) with extraordinary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. My other reaſon was, that Dr. Gage reſiding at Paris at the tyme his Lordship dyed, and intending for his Country, ſent me à letter wherin he requeſted me to grant him the ordinary faculties pertaining to the miſſionaries of this houſe ſaying that he did not thinke that the Chapter had power to grant them; and indeed a Bishops authoritie expires and dyes with him; vnleſs <hi>Ius commune Canomcuns,</hi> or <hi>prinilegium ſpeciale

Theſe were the grounds and reaſons of my Counſell communicated in my letter to Mr. Knightly; but Mr. Harrington, and the principall Chapter-men Mr. Blacloes Adherents deſpiſed them: they neuer ſought to the Court of Rome till they were conſtrained ſo to do, our Brethren generally preſſing the London Chapter-men (which managed all affairs) to ſend an Agent to Rome for the obtaining of a Succeſſour, and confirming of their Chapter. But from the death of my lord Bish: and afore alſo they had ſo deported themſelues, that their Agent Mr. Plantin return'd without a letter written from his Holines, or the Protector, to the Chapter that ſent him: which nothing troubled Mr. Blacloe, and his party. For though Mr. Blacloe had no opinion of my lords Epiſcopall authoritie while his Lordship was aliue: neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs he made no doubt of the Chapters Epiſcopall authoritie, my lord being dead; beſids he defended openly in the Aſſembly of 1657. what he had aſſerted in his printed Inſti. Tom. 2. lee. 8. parity between a Bishop and a mere Prieſt, as witneſſeth Mr. Progers, that was in the ſaid Aſſembly in his letter vvritten to myſelfe and dated 14. Novemb. 1657. (which I haue shewn to our Seniors) <hi>I told</hi> (ſais he) <hi>the members thereof,</hi> Mr. <hi>Blacloe being preſent that I thought they intended not a Bishop.</hi> And in his letter dated Nouemb. 28. 1657. (which I haue showen likewiſe to our Seniors) wherin he giues me an account of all proceedings in 4. ſeuerall meetings, or conſults, in the 7. account, he hath theſe expreſs words: <hi>It much encreaſd my ſuſpicion of their being ſatiſfyed with their preſent Gouernement, and not to deſire a Bishop to ſee them ſo peremptory in refuſing to ſubſcribe to a diſclaime from all nouelties and ſcandalous opinions taught by</hi> Mr. <hi>VVhite, alias Blacloe.</hi> Tis Mr. white togeather with the London Chapter-men his proſelytes that haue ruin'd our whole Clergy by depriuing them of their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall head, which might haue preuented many great ſcandals. Howeuer they ſtill continue ſo obſtinate in their wayes, that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:108708:53"/>whatſoeuer Brother does shew himſelfe againſt Mr. Blacloe, or an enemy to their inordinate proceedings they repreſent him to our Brethren reſiding in the Country, as diſaffected to their Chapter, ſeditious, and factious: and young miſſionaries if they do not ſay as they do vnto extolling Mr. Blacloes, <hi>Vnimpeachable vertue, vmblemisht life, and moſt eminent Doctrines</hi> (which art the illuſtrious characters Dr. Ellis, Mr. Curtis &amp;c. giue him in their Encyclicall letter to endeare him thereby to all our Brethren) they menace, and depriue them of common charities, as men diſaffected to their Chapter. And truly at my being at London Sundry Prieſts did complaine vnto me of thoſe horrid abuſes. And in order to my owne particular as I haue beene conſtant in expreſſing an extreame abhorrence from Mr. Blacloes pernicious Doctrines: ſo they haue been as conſtant in caſting vpon me ſlanders, and procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming me an enimy to the Chapter eſtablyshd by two Bishops (vpon that scoare onely) though God is my witnes, I euer eſteemd a Chapter the beſt Gouernement our Clergy could haue, and the beſt means to ſecure vnto them a Bishop, which is the naturall head of Clergy Prieſts. But I profeſs ingenuouſely that my hart often tymes hath been ſwallowd vp with heauynes to ſee ſuch as manage affairs, carryed away with the winde of prophane Doctrines vnto the looſing of that beſt Gouernement. And this shall ſuffice in Anſwere to all the pages of the Ency<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clicall letter, wherin I am accuſed for hauing a gird at, or going about to diſſolue the Chapter, that being ſo falſe, that as God beſt know's I neuer had the leaſt thought that way: my zeale tending onely to the preſeruing of our Chapter, and Chapter-men from ſuffering preiudice. And to diſſuade from the exerciſe of Epiſcopall authoritie, till a Succeſſour might be conſtituted, was not to inuade, but to conſerue the Chapter, nor to perſuade the Chapter-men to a diſclaim from wicked Doctrines vnto taking away of ſcandalls, was to hurt, but to ſaue their honour, and reputation. But as to what our two Bishops did act in the eſtablishing of the Chapter, I do aſſure it was in order, reference,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:108708:54"/>and expectation of the ſea Apoſtolicks confirmation as appeares plainely by ſending of Agents to Rome, and by their frequent ſolicitations, and ſupplications exhibited to his Holines for the obtaining of a confirmation.

For in this caſe not onely his Holines approbation, but diſpenſation is required in order to the Churches ordinances which confine Chapter-men to a Collegiate, or Cathedrall Church, for ſuch an end, and purpoſe.

My true tale in order to both the accuſations, is as followeth.</p>
                  <p>About the yeare 1656. Mr. Blacloe being much incens'd at the aboue mentioned Letter ſent Mr. Knightly, ſet forth in print a larg phamplet full of calumnies, and reprochfull language, vnto wounding of my honour, and reputation, which he and his Adherents ſpread in great diligence, and extreame exulting, and triumphing there was amongſt his friends at home, and abroad, at Paris eſpecially (where reſided principall Clergy men, and Lay-Catholiks of our Country, which ſupported, counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced, and defended Mr. Blacloe and his learning) imagining that the ſaid pamphlet had caſt vpon me ſo great an affront, and diſgrace, that my reſiſting of Mr. Blacloes learning would ſignify nothing for the future. But mens ſuppoſals, and Gods directions ſeldome agree. For this proceeding miniſtred the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that begot my <hi>Manifeſt,</hi> which laid open ſo plainely his crafty dealings, and extreame ambition to begin a plantation of new notions, and pernicious Tenets, that the veile, which hid his vngodly purpoſes being drawn, and taken away thereby, he appeared, what he was indeed, <hi>A wolfe in ſheeps Cloathing:</hi> Now after Mr. Blacloes chief friends reſiding at Paris had peruſed my <hi>Manifeſt,</hi> and heard of the applauſe it had got amongſt all ſort of Catholicks reſpectiuely, as appeares by aboue 20. ſundry Letters: then and neuer afore, Dr. Holden, and Mr. Car thought it expedient to endeuour an accord between my ſelfe, and Mr.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:108708:56"/>Blacloe, vnder the ſpecious colour of bringing the whole Clergy vnto vnion thereby, and for the effecting of this deſign they got the right Hon. the Lord Abbot Montague, and the Hon. Mr. Clifford to engage in the purſuance thereof, wherin they carryed themſelues moſt piouſly, and Religiouſly, hoping to extinguish thereby the fire of diſcord, and diſſention which Mr. Blacloes prophane nouelties had kindled in our Clergy. In order here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Mr. Clifford, and Mr. Car: gaue me a viſit at our Mother-Houſe, deliuered a Letter ſubſcribed by the Rt. Hon. the Lord Abbot Montague, Dr. Holden, and themſelues expreſſing their ioynt deſire for a ſetlement of peace and Vnion vnto taking away diuiſion, wherewith our ſaid Clergy was branded: and in ſum me wishd conference with me about the carrying on of ſo good a worke; and for my part I shew'd as great a willingnes to embrace, as they had demonſtrated readines to promote ſo good a worke.</p>
                  <p>In our firſt conference I excepted againſt the Letter for as much, as I ſaw, that it was written by Dr. Holden, and as I conceiued by him contriued out of information receiued from the aduerſe party and indeed diuers points thereof I might haue diſprou'd. Howeuer I was not a litle troubled to ſee Dr. Holdens hand to the Letter who was a party againſt me, and had enough to do for his own works; for when I was at Paris Dr. Holden put forth a pamphlet vnbeſeeming his Religion, and function, wherin he accuſed the Court of Rome of ignorance and corruption: likewiſe he had ſet forth a booke much dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating from the Popes authority. Again neither Mr. Clifford nor Mr. Car mou'd me to approue the contents of the ſaid Letter, the intent thereof being onely to expreſs a ioynt deſire of peace and Vnion which I embrac'd gladly, and accordingly propounded ſuch points, as I iudg'd neceſſary requiſits to the effecting of peace and Vnion. Which were theſe 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, that Mr. Blacloe might ſubmitt all his writings to the ſea Apoſtolick and print nothing more without the approbation of theſe Drs. of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:108708:56"/>Diuinity named in the common Letter ſent Mr. Blacloe, and ſubſcribed by the R<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Hon. the Lord Abbot Montague, and the other three. Secondly that ſome of our graueſt and chiefeſt Brethren out of each Diſtrict reſpectiuely might aſſemble togeather to determine of all affairs pertaining to our Clergy, and I nam'd graue and principall Brethren, becauſe I knew well that the farre maior part of our Brethren then pertaining to the Chapter, were a pack of Mr. Blacloes friends, ſo that it ſeem'd to me a thing impoſſible to vote down in ſuch a Chapter, his prophane Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, on the extinguishing whereof peace, and Vnion neceſſarily depended. Beſides I knew likewiſe, that ſome of our Brethren had reſigned, and others had refuſed to accept Eccleſiaſticall dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities (in our Bishops life tyme) that ſo they might avoide conteſts with Mr. Blacloe and his party; and truly in the yeare 1654. by order from my Lord Bish: I mou'd Dr. Daniel twiſe to accept of the Vicar Generalship <hi>In ſolidum,</hi> who replyed vnto me in a Letter the 10. of Ian. 1654. in theſe expreſs words. (I haue shewn it to our Seniors) <hi>You moue again, and I ſee my lord is ready to honour me far aboue my deſert and expectation. Truly Sr. I am not ſo wedded to my own defires, or Intereſts (vvhich hath long been to lead a ſingle, and quiet life) as not to yeild my vimoſt endeuors to the common, vvhen it may appeare that I may really further it: Giue me leaue therefore to repreſent my doubts, I conceiue in this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ffered employment. Firſt then Mr. Clifford telleth my Lord, that noe exceptions vvill be made againſt me; but this I much feare, becauſe Mr. Blacloe is, as yet, no vvay appeaſed, or ſatisfyed vvith me, and then certainely beth he, Dr. Holden, and both their friends, vvill oppoſe me vvhat they can.</hi> And although afterwards Dr. Daniel made his peace with Mr. Blacloe, and thereupon was choſen Dean (which happened after my Lord Bishops death) neuertheleſs he iudg'd it neceſſary for our Clergy to diſclaime from Mr. Blacloes new notions vnto extinguishing the fire of diſcord, as can witnes Mr. Wolſtan Paſton, a Lay-Catholick of great worth, and merit, whoſe ſingular charity hath extreamely obliged both the ſecular
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:108708:57"/>and regular Clergy. Thirdly being I was of Dr. Daniels opinion, as to the neceſſity of a diſclaime, I propounded that our Brethren aſſembled togeather might in the firſt place diſauow all Doctrines contrary to the generall practiſe of Gods Church, whether vented by Mr. Blacloe, or any other, as likewiſe to giue obedience to ſuch declarations or declaration as his Holines should make in order to prophane nouelties.</p>
                  <p>This was the ſum of what I propounded to the Hon. Mr. Clifford, and Mr. Car for the effecting of our deſired Vnion: and they approu'd each point thereof, and at their return to Paris acquainted therewith the Rt. Hon.<hi rend="sup">ble</hi> the Lord Abbot Montague, who in a Letter dated 13. of Octob. (which I shewd to our Seniors) writeth to me in theſe expreſs words. <hi>I doubt not but at the meeting propoſed, vvhich vvill be more conuenient at London, then Paris</hi> (I had propounded to Mr. Clifford, and Mr. Car that our Brethren might meet at Paris) <hi>by reaſon of the impoſſibility of ſo many appearing here, as are requifit to that vvorke, the propoſall is to be made of diſauowing all that is new, and vnconformable to the receiued practiſe, and Doctrine of the Church of Rome, and promiſe to ſubmit to any declaration, the Pope shall make in point of nonelties either vented already by Mr. Blacloe or any other, or vvhat shall occurr here after vpon any declaration. This profeſſion I iudge conuenient to be made in the entry of that Aſſembly vve propoſe, and am aſſured of the acceptance of it vnanimouſely, which anſwers fully to Yr. deſire.</hi> This Teſtimony alone comming from a perſon of ſo great eminency, as is my Lord Abbot Montague giues euidence enough to shew to our Brethren how falſely Dr. Ellis, Mr. Onrtis &amp;c. haue accuſed me of forgetting my promiſe to the obſtructing of the deſired Vnion.</p>
                  <p>And if my Deputy, Mr. Progers excepted againſt the Aſſembly for as much as the far maior part thereof was a pack of Mr. Blacloe friends, and if in the firſt place he vrged the diſauowing of nouelle Doctrines, he proceeded according to his inſtructions, which were conform to the propounded poynts, and approu'd
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:108708:57"/>vnanimouſly by my Lord Abbot, Mr. Clifford, and Mr. Car, as neceſſary requiſits to the effecting of the ſaid deſired Vnion, and this shall ſuffice in anſwer to the ſlander caſt vpon me in the cited 13. pag.</p>
                  <p>Now as to the common Letter ſet down pag. 10. it ſeems to me a ſtrang thing, that Dr. Ellis, Mr. Curtis &amp;c. should produce the ſaid Letter with intent to preiudice me, ſince I was not required to admit, and acknowledge the contents thereof as to matter of fact, which I purpoſely wau'd regarding onely the ioynt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> deſire in Order to Vnion. Again I can in rigour deny the Letter as it is ſet down, to be the common Letter ſubſcribed by the Rt. Hon. the Lord Montague &amp;c. I can perſonate them and ſay, as Martiall the Poet did to one Fidentinus, that had rehearſd a poeme of his amiſs.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Quem recitas, meus eſt, ô Fidentine, libellus:</l>

                  </q>
                  <p>FOR example Dr. Ellis, Mr. Curtis &amp;c. to make our Brethren belieue that by that Letter I onely am deſired not to reſiſt the authority, which two late Bishops eſtablish'd, and left amongſt vs, in the room of <hi>Earneſtly requeſting you</hi> (to witt my ſelfe and Mr. Blacloe ioyntly, as plainely appeares in the originall Letter) they ſet down <hi>Earneſtly requeſting him</hi> (Dr. Leyb.) And whereas immediately follow theſe words directed to my ſelfe alone; <hi>This authority we are confident you are far from oppoſing, vnleſs, as perceiuing it led, and gouernd by a faction of Mr. VVhites.</hi> In earneſt Dr. Ellis, Mr. Curtis &amp;c. haue vſed crafty dealing in the changing of <hi>You</hi> into <hi>Him,</hi> but eſpecially in omitting to ſet down the other words immediately following. <hi>This authority we are conſident you are far from oppoſing &amp;c</hi> They had no deſire our Brethren should know, that my Lord Abbot, Mr. Clifford &amp;c. were conſident, that my ſelfe was far from oppoſing our
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:108708:58"/>Chapter, that is, the authority eſtablish'd by two Bishops, <hi>vnleſs</hi> &amp;c. or that our ſaid Brethren should know, that my Lord Abbot &amp;c. did make a difference between oppoſing the Chapter, as Chapter, and oppoſing Mr. Whites faction, as leading and gouerning it, and therefore conceald that part of the Letter, becauſe Mr. Curtis &amp;c. repreſent, as enemyes to the Chapter, all ſuch Brethren, as shew a diſlike of, or moue a diſclaime from Mr. Whites pernicious nouelties; nay my ſelfe is proclaimd in their Encyclicall Epiſtle as girding at, and ſeeking diſſolution of the Chapter, becauſe at my laſt being in London out of pure loue, and Zeale, I told Dr. Ellis, that although the Chapter were without exception, he ought not to exerciſe any Iuriſdiction as Dean, in regard his election according to the Churches Canons was made void, becauſe he had not accepted his ſaid election with in the prefixed time, ſet downe by the Canons which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire acceptance of election within the ſpace of one moneth, and Dr. Ellis did not accept it within the ſpace of 8. months: Beſides <hi>Priuantut iure per electionem acquiſito; qui poſt acceptationem intra tres menſes confirmationem non petunt. C. quam ſit. de Elec. &amp; Elect. pores. in</hi> 6. <hi>Item qui ante Confirmationem adminiſtrant. ibi. C.

                  <p>Furthermore if Dr. Ellis, Mr. Curtis &amp;c. had been minded to deale ſincerely in publishing my Lord Abbot, Mr. Clifford &amp;c. their religious endeauours in order to the afore mentioned Vnion in our Clergy, they should not haue produced onely, their common Letter to me, but like wiſe their common Letter to Mr. Blacloe, which they craftily conceal'd from our Brethren; becauſe my Lord Abbot, Mr. Clifford &amp;c. in their ſaid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Letter ſent Mr. Blacloe (wherof a Copie was giuen me) haue theſe expreſs words: <hi>If herefier you intend to publish any thing concerning or nearly relating to Religion, you vvill be pleaſd to lee it be peruſed, and conſented vnto by Mr. Bluſion Mr. Daniel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mr. Ellis, Mr. Gennings Dis. if Diuinity.</hi> And in the cloſe of the common better<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>Here Dr. Ellis, and Mr. Curtis &amp;c. produce a copie of Mr. Blacloe's ſubmitting his writings to the Sea Apoſtolick, and both they, and all other his Adherents much glory therin without cauſe: for indeed that his ſubmiſſion ſignifies nothing, fince Mr. Blacloe, and his pack of friends, ſoon after in the Aſſembly 1657. did not onely reiect his Holines Decrees, that prohibited, and condemned ſundry of his prophane books, but alſo went about to forewarne our Brethren againſt cenſures from Rome, <hi>If procur'd by indirect wayes</hi> (againſt Mr. Blacloe) <hi>though by direct they should come to them:</hi> I vſe Mr. Progers (that was preſent) his words ſet down in the 9. account of the declaration he ſent me as to the paſſages of that Aſſembly, and he ſais further in the ſame account, that in order to that fore warning he made this Quere. <hi>Be not ſuch preuention and foreſtalling, the beginning of Rebellion in the ſtate, and ſchiſme in the Church?</hi> Moreouer whereas I ſent the ſaid Decrees to Mr. Knightly by order from the Nuncio, Mr. Curtis writt vnto me vnaduiſedly, ſaying that he wonder'd that I would ſend Decrees, which I knew did not bind there: and of this vnhandſome writting I chalengd him, when laſt I was at London: But <hi>Bone Deus in quae tempora, hoc eſt, in quam dierum inobedientiam nos reſeruaſti?</hi> Again ſince the reiecting of the ſaid Decrees, Mr. Blacloe hath put forth a pernicious book intitled <hi>Statera morum,</hi>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:108708:59"/>fiilled with fordid, and damnable Doctrines, and this he dedicates to the Bishops of this Country: alſo hath diſperſd it in ſundry places, with deſign to ſtirre vp ſuch as are addicted to Ianſeniſme vnto rebellion againſt the authority of the ſea Apoſtolick: wherefore ſince Mr. Blacloes ſubſequent actions haue vnmade, what his precedent Act, as to ſubmitting to the Pope, had made afore, his ſubmiſſion now ſignifies nothing; in conſequence of which the producing of it muſt of neceſſity turne to the sham of Mr. Blacloe, and ſuch as produce it in his fauour. Wanton ſchollars of new notions in all ages whiles they were without a Potentate to protect, or a ſtrong party to ſecure them from the power of Rome, ſubmitted their writings to the Pope; a ſtratageme onely to gain tyme vnto ſpreading, and eſtablishing of their wicked Doctrines. And indeed Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtories make mention of ſundry Hereticks ſubmiſſion of their Doctrines to the ſea Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, before they were faſt in the ſaddle.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 12. Mr. <hi>Blacloes reply to his</hi> (Dr. Leyb.) <hi>pamphlet, though printed and ready to be publisht, vvas held in by him, (Mr. Blacloe) and Mr. Leyb. permitted to haue the laſt word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the diſprouuing of this Tale, I can ſay thus much, Mr. Car himſelfe told me, that Dr. Holden had receiued a Letter from Mr. Blacloe, wherein was ſignifyed, that he had an Anſwer in readines to Dr. Leyburns booke, and Dr. Holden writ back vnto him, that if he had prepared an Anſwer he should do well to light a fagot and burne it: for he would gain nothing of credit by anſwering it. This Mr. Car had from Dr. Holden himſelfe. Again as to reaſon it is not probable that Mr. Blacloe would ſuppreſs his Anſwer, if printed, out of his innate goodnes to ſpare me; The Encyclicall Epiſtle, that breath's forth ranck poiſon of malice, giues euidence enough of his, Dr. Ellis, Mr. Curtis &amp;c. their great charity towards me. But perhaps the ſaid Encyclicall Epiſtle is cut out of the ſaid Anſwer which lies hid out of baſhfulnes.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 16. Mr. Mark Harrington our late Sub-Dean he (Mr.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:108708:59"/>Leyb.) iudges to haue dy'd in a ſad caſe;</p>
                  <p>In Anſwer to this accuſation I ſay 1.<hi rend="sup">o</hi> that it ſeems to me a ſtrang thing that Dr. Ellis, Mr. Curtis &amp;c. dare name Mr. Harrington Sub-Dean, ſince my Lord Bish. in his Letter to Mr. Harrington, &amp; Mr. Curtis, alias Peterſon afore produced, ſays expreſly, that neither himſelfe nor any other who had authority from him, gaue Mr. Harrington ſuch an office, and thence his Lordship infer'd that they vſurped vpon Epiſcopall authority by aſſuming to themſelues Spirituall authority giuen by none. Secondly, as to Mr. Harringtons dying condition, Dr. Ellis, Mr. Curtis &amp;c. atteſt point blanck, that I iudge him to haue dyed in a ſad caſe; but in regard their Teſtimony importes an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation without proof, of neceſſity it beares the infamous marke of a ſlander; and indeed ſuch are the other aſperſions they caſt vpon me all a long their Encyclicall Epiſtle. Beſides I know well that the power of iudging is a reſeru'd caſe pertaining to the ſon of God Ioan. 5. <hi>Pater omne indicium dedit Filio.</hi> Yet notwithſtanding all this tis lawfull for me, or any other Catholick, that was acquainted with Mr. Harringtons peruerſe, and obſtinate defending of Mr. Blacloes pernicious Doctrines, to conceiue coniecturally, that the Tribunall of the ſame ſon of God (which iudgeth euery one according to his works 2. Cor. 5.) might shew him nothing of fauour, ſince in the ſicknes of which he dyed, he had made no outward shew of diſauowing them, though his Dean Mr. Fitton, brought to the like extremity, had diſauow'd them.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, whereas Mr. Knightly, the Gen. Vicar, had writ vnto me, that Mr. Harrington after a ſicknes of many dayes was departed out of the world without receiuing any one Sacrament, as likewiſe without diſpoſing of any one penny vnto procuring of prayers for the benefit of his ſoul, perhaps I ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in my Anſwer, that thereby might appeare a iuſt iudgement of God that Mr. Harrington, who in his life tyme had impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned the efficacy of holy Churches Sacraments as to conferring
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:108708:60"/>of Sanctifying grace, and the Sacramentall abſolution as to taking away ſins without perfect contrition, and alſo the deliuerance of good ſouls out of purgatory through the prayers and ſuffrages of the Church, before the generall Reſurrection, should want the comfort, and benefit of the Sacramentall viaticum, that is the holy Euchariſte, the Sacrament of Extream-Vnction, and a Prieſts Sacramentall abſolution, but hence can onely be inferd, that I might conceiue (as indeed ſo I did, and do ſtill) Mr. Harringtons death not to haue been outwardly at leaſt ſo pious, and precious in the ſight of Heauen, and earth, as the Encyclicall Epiſtle, makes it. For truly I do think that neither the Heauen of the Church triumphant, nor the Earth of the Church militant do approue the death of ſuch, as dye with ſingularity of Doctrine, which is contrary to faith, and the generall practiſe of Catholick belieuers; howeuer to thinke or conceiue Mr. Harrington to haue dyed in a ſad condition in order to outward ſigns and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, is not to iudge him as to the Tribunall of the ſon of God, who for as much as his mercy is aboue all his works, might aſſiſt him with efficacious illuminations in the laſt moment of life: men can onely form conceptions conform to outward ſenſible actions; tis God alone, that hath inſpection into the whole man, and conſequently it is he alone, that can iudge him, who hath an exact knowledge of both his outward, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward action.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 21. <hi>Fiftly they obiect Dr. Leyb. vſuall calumny, that his Holines iudges our Chapter ſchiſmaticall — ſo that we feare himſelfe endeuour'd to fix that calumny vpon vs at Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In Anſwer to this obiecton which is built vpon <hi>Dictum proprium</hi> (a Teſtimony without proofe, that Dr. Ellis, &amp;c. vſe all a long their <hi>Encyclicall Epiſtle</hi>) I proteſt fincerely that it is ſo falſe, that as God knows beſt I neuer had an intent to brand the Chapter with ſchiſm, or inform againſt it at Rome. Howeuer I am very certain that the Apoſtolick ſeat, does harbour no good opinion of Mr. Blacloe; for Dr. Gage their Agent in his Letter of Feb.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:108708:60"/>20. 1661. (which hath been shewn to our Seniors) hath theſe expreſs words. <hi>Mr. Blacloe Doctrine is in ſo great a deteſtation here, that neither that of Luther or Caluin euer vvas in a greater.</hi> Whereby is euidene'd, that Mr. Blacloe hath no ſuch enimy, as his own Doctrine, nor our Chapter any ſuch Aduerſaries in the Court of Rome, as are thoſe Chapter-men, that adhere ſo faſt vnto him, as to dare to publish his Doctrine for eminent learning, which is held in deteſtation at Rome, cenſur'd by the Vuiuerſity of Doway as ſcandalous, Hereticall and impious. Theſe London Chapter-men are thoſe, which if not preuented by a ſupream prouidence, of neceſſity will bring our Clergy to ruine: and wheras Dr. Ellis, Mr. Curtis &amp;c. endeuour after their wonted manner to abuſe our Brethren by ſeeking to perſuade that euen in this preſent tyme our Chapter is in eſteem, and credit at Rome, I dare boldly ſay vnto diſabuſing our ſayd Brethren, that it is ſo odious (as they haue made it) that not any friend of our Clergy reſiding in that Court will preſume to open his mouth in fauour of it.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 24. <hi>VVe shew him</hi> (Dr. Leyb.) <hi>the iudgements of Canon lawyers, who were conſulted when our Chapter was inſtituted, one of them being Ottenbergus Biſhop of Arras — we shew him vnder</hi> Mr. <hi>Fitt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>This obiection hath two branches, whereof one is built vpon the iudgements of Canon lawyers as to a Bishops power vnto inſtituting a Chapter: which importes nothing of the queſtion in debate, to wit, whether a Chapter inſtituted by a Bishop can ſucceed in Epiſcopall authority at the death of their Bishop without his Holines obtained condeſcention thereto? or whether a Dean elected a new is not bound to aſke confirmation of his election before the exerciſing of Epiſcopall Iuriſdiction? If Dr. Ellis, Mr. Curtis &amp;c. could haue produced Ottenbergus or any other Canon lawyers Teſtimony, that might haue decided the

                  <p>The other branche is built vpon a teſtimony vnder Mr. Fittons own hand as Dr. Ellis, Mr. Curtis &amp;c. auerre, although in good earneſt I haue no inducement from the words ſet down to giue credence vnto them. 1.<hi rend="sup">o</hi> becauſe to my knowledge Mr. Fitton was at Paris when Innocentius was made Pope, and there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for the ſpace of diuers yeares.

                  <p>Pag. 27. <hi>Laſtly we bring him his</hi> (Mr. Leyb.) <hi>own Letter aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that our Chapter was to haue Epiſcopall Iuriſdiction after my Lords death—that the Chapter is to be look't on, as his Heir <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>To this accuſation I anſwer: inregard I haue found by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience that Dr. Ell is, Mr. Curtis &amp;c. do corrupt, and falſity the originall Letters, which they mention in their Encyclicall Epiſtle,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:108708:61"/>I cannot be induc'd to belieue, that they haue repeated my words aright, neither do I thinke that there are the particles <hi>Our Chapter</hi> &amp;c. I remember that vpon notice giuen me, that Mr. Blacloe, and his Party went about to out my Lord Bishop from his Epiſcopall authority, and that Dr. Blundſton vpon that ſcoare endeuour'd to draw all our Brethren reſiding in his diſtrict, to promiſe obedience to the Chapter, I writ the ſaid Dr. Blun. a Letter, telling him that he proceeded vnaduiſedly becauſe a Chapter ought not to execute the Bishops authority while he was aliue. For in all Catholick Contries where Bishops ſeats are eſtablish'd, the Bishop while he liues gouernes the Clergy, and not the Chapter: to which (if Cathedrall) the Canons of the Church giue leaue onely to ſuceeed in his authoritie during the vacancy of the ſeat. And if a new Dean be elected in the meane while, or afterwards, he is bound by the ſaid Canons to aske of his Holines confirmation, as, to his election, otherwiſe it is null, and inualide: wherefore to haue writ that <hi>the,</hi> or <hi>a Chapter is looks on as the Biſhops Heir apparent,</hi> or that <hi>our gouernement is to reſide in the Chapter after our maſters death,</hi> is not to approue the exerciſe of Epiſcopall Iuriſdiction in the Chapter without his Holines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention thereto: and this I counſeld as a neceſſary requiſit to our gouernement my Lord Bishop being dead. But my Counſell had no weight with, Mr. Blacloe and his Adherents, who play'd not one, but many Bishops ſuddenly, without conſulting the ſupream Paſtour.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 27. <hi>Sometymes he Charges Mr. Blacloe with cozenage, and iniuſtice, as that he has embez'ld, or conuerted to other vſes a ſumme of money left in his hand for the Clergies good: whereas vve knovv the contrary by diuers perſons, in vvhoſe hands, and to vvhoſe truſt, he left the ſaid ſumme, to be employ'd hereafter for the good of the Clergy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In Anſwer to this accuſation, I ſay, that Dr. Ellis, Mr. Curtis &amp;c. do me wrong, for as much as they aſſert, that I haue accuſed Mr. Blacloe of cozenage and iniuſtice as to embezling a ſumme of money committed to his care, and truſt; I neuer Charg'd
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:108708:62"/>him with iniuſtice as to ſpending the principall ſtock, but for conuerting to his own vſe the Rents thereof contrary to all iuſtice. For example our laſt Bishop about 55. yeates agoe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaild with an Hon.<hi rend="sup">ble</hi> perſon his friend to beſtow a ſumme of money vnto the erecting and maintaining of a litle community in the Town of Paris which might conſiſt of ſuch Clergy-men as their Superior should iudge fit and proper for the end the erection was intended, to wit, for the keeping a continuall ſucceſſion of able ſchollars as to poſitiue, ſcholaſticall, and polemicall Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie eſpecially; knowledge in controuerſies being thought neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary vnto reſiſting the Enemies of Catholick Religion. To the aduancing of ſo good a worke the moſt R<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. and Illuſtrious Abbot of Arras lent our Clergy a ſmall Colledge, built in the ſaid Towne of Paris pertaining to his Monaſtery, and therefore named the Colledge of Arras. The money procured for the entertainment of this community was deliuered into the hands of Mr. Iohn Colleton to whom the truſt was committed; but he, in regard of his impriſonment thought fit to recommend the truſt, and management of the ſaid fund vnto Mr. Iohn Hammon, who about the yeare 1640. entruſted Mr. Blacloe with it, who hath neuer employed one penny for the end, the fund was erected. The Rents that maintained conſtantly afore a community of ſome fiue prime Clergy-men (and indeed two Bishops, and two Deans were of Arras Colledge community) now entertaine Mr. Blacloe in poore cloathing. Of this Mr. Blacloes moſt vniuſt dealing at my laſt being at London I complain'd to Mr. Curtis that receiues the Rents, and told him plainely that it was a mighty shame to our Clergy to ſuffer or countenance ſuch an vnworthy, ſcandalous, and vniuſt proceeding. To which Mr. Curtis replyed ſaying: <hi>But how can vve helpe it, Mr. Blacloe is entruſted with the money: vve cannot take it from him but he ſay's that he vvill leaue it to the Clergy. Beſides ſaid Mr. Curtis; Mr. Blacloe hath giuen to Liſboa one hundred pounds, and allovv's the Dean Dr. Ellis thirty pounds yearely, and twenti pounds yearly to Mr.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:108708:62"/>Robert VVorſley out of the Rents of an other fund left by Dr. Boſvvel, and vvherevvith Mr. Blacloe is alſo entruſted.</hi> What I haue herein ſet down in relation to the fund of Arras Colledge, I proteſt ſincerely, I heard from Mr. Collingtons own mouth, from my Lord Bishop, from Dr. Kelliſon, and Dr. Louell: beſides I haue ſome reaſon to haue full knowledge of the ſaid fund, becauſe my ſelfe togeather with Mr. Bitcon, Dr. Blundſton, Mr. Ireland, and Dr. Reyners, were entertain'd in Arras Colledge, and maintained with the Rents thereof. And as to the ſubſtance of my anſwers to Mr. Curtis afore-mentioned, I will be depos'd, that I haue expreſſed them moſt ſincerely. Wherefore I leaue it to the wiſedom's of our Bhrethren to iudge, whether Dr. Ellis does not commit a grieuous ſin, for as much as he employes money to his own, that was giuen, and alwais afore applyed to another vſe and purpoſe, that is the entertaining and maintaining of a ſmal community in the Town of Paris. For indeed Mr. Blacloe hath noe colour of right as to the dominion or diſpoſing of the ſaid fund in any other way: and this truth does euidently appeare by a continuall cuſtome of paying the Rents for the vſe of ſuch a community, and by the Teſtimonies of Dr. Boſwel, and other principall members of our ancient Clergy which are extant in our Mother Houſe, and my ſelfe haue ſeen them.</p>

His Lordship replyed as to his own order, that he had not condemned Mr. Blacloe; and indeed a meer order to ſuppreſs a book, does not importe a condemnation, taken in the proper ſenſe. Secondly as to my clamorous decrying, his Lordship anſwer'd, that he neuer gaue me order to cry out againſt Mr. Blacloes books, there being a great difference between crying out againſt, and a gentle ſuppreſſing: and likewiſe between ſuppreſſing all ſpeech againſt, and meer ſuppreſſing of a booke.

For although to pronounce ſentence of condemnation againſt Teachers of new notions, which contradict Councils, and the generall practiſe of Gods Church, is the ſupreme Vniuerſall Paſtour's prerogatiue: neuertheleſs the Paſtorall ſtaff is not giuen to a particular Biſhop in vain. Beſides euery particular Biſhop, for as much as he is the Chief Spirituall Dog of the ſuprem Paſtour, is bound to barke, and fight againſt ſuch, as endeauour to hurt his flock. If a wolfe come, and the ſheapard's Dog shall not giue warning thereof by barking, of neceſſity he will be counted guilty of betraying the Sheep vnto the wolfe. The french (as <hi>Cicero</hi> in one oration relateth) attempted to ſeiſe on the Capitol of Rome, and becauſe the watch, or Guard Dogs did not barke vnto giuing notice of their comming, they were brought before the common Court of iuſtice, and there ſentenc'd to haue their things broken. Prieſts, yea Lay-Catholick's (as to the matter in debate) but Bishops eſpecially, are the Spirituall watch-Dogs of the ſupreame Paſtour: and their office is to barke at and bite wolfes, that go about ſeeking among the flock of Chriſt, whom they may deceiue, and deuoure: that is to ſay, they are bound to ſpeake, teach, and write againſt ſingular Doctours of new notions which are wolfes in ſheep's cloathing, and ſuch, as to this poynt, shall neglect the duty, that God requireth from them, will receiue their Triall at the high Court of diuine Iuſtice,

                     </q> And indeed the firſt Council of Nice, as witneſſeth Nicephorus l. 8.

                  <p>As to Mr. Blacloes moſt vnblemiſh't life, and vnimpeachable vertue, which be the glorious Characters giuen him all a long the Encyclicall Epiſtle, tis euident as to reaſon; that if the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Dr. Ellis &amp;c. were built vpon truth, Mr. Blacloe would neuer haue writ my Lord Bish. ſuch a Letter, as is afore ſet down, wherin he calleth a Brother equall to him ſelfe <hi>Lying and periur'd ſycophant, a wret'hed ſycophant &amp;c.</hi> and brand's his Lordship's own ſelfe with the infamous markes of <hi>Paramount Biſhop,</hi> and <hi>domineering wayes.</hi> Nor is it, as to reaſon conſonant, that my

                  <p>As to Mr. Blacloes eminent learning in regard whereof Dr. Ellis &amp;c. highly value him; that alone bring's vndeniable eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt his vnimpeachable vertue, and vnblemish't life: for indeed his learning is the <hi>Vanity of vanities</hi> Eccle. 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. in as much as t'is built vpon heathen Philoſophy: and <hi>Abomination of deſolation</hi> Mar. 13. becauſe it is deſtructiue of Religon, and morality, as I shall euidently proue out of a ſmall draught or extract onely, of his vain abominable Tenets, which I haue thought expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to ſet down (vnto a fulnes of ſatiſfaction in order to all our Brethren, and Lay-Catholicks) vvhich are as follow's</p>
                  <p>Imprimis Mr. Blacloe as to his learning, is deſtructiue of Gods

                  <p>Item he is extreamely iniurious to the Holy Ghoſt, for T. 1. p. 278.

                  <p>Item he is iniurious to the Canon law, becauſe Monum. pag. 62. he ſcruple's not to teach that no Canons, that concerne the outward Court of the Church, and ſundry Degrees of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall dignities pertaining thereto, oblige in England; and this opinion aſſerted by ſo claſſicall an Author, as Mr. Blacloe is, purgeth out the leauen of ſcruples as to our London Chapter-Men's proceedings.</p>
                  <p>Item he is iniurious without pitty to many wretched ſinners. For To. 2. Inſt. p. 357. he impiouſly affirm's, that their is an abſolute impoſſibility for many of them to auoid damnation: and indeed he denies abſolutely all ſufficient grace To. 1. Inſt. pag. 124. though ſometymes he grantes it, as giuen onely by God, that man may beare the guilt of ſin: which is that man may
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:108708:69"/>commit ſin. And perhaps he means by wretched ſinners, which he called wretched men, Carthuſians, Capucins, and other Religious orders. 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. becauſe he teacheth To. 2. Inſ. pag. 207. that life to be the beſt requiſit to bleſſednes which enioyes the fulnes of corporall pleaſures, and that ſinnes (in an other place) are perfections of the ſoul. Secondly becauſe in his book of Meditations he nameth the vertus of Religious Orders Idioticall, and in his booke of Obed. &amp; Gou. ground 4. he affirmes that <hi>Obedience is a vertue onely in caſe of imperfection: as likewiſe teacheth that to renounce our vvil, is to renounce our vvits, and manhood, and compares it to the going vpon of all four like a Beaſt. Malitia excaeeauit cor illius. Pro.</hi> 17.</p>
                  <p>Item he is iniurious to all the Churches Sacraments inſtituted by Chriſt himſelfe, for as much, as Tom. 2. l. 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Inſt. lec. 8. he nameth <hi>them certain contracts onely betvveen God,</hi> and man without any efficacy as to Sanctifying mans ſoul. He does not belieue that the Sacramentall water in Baptiſm that toucheth the body waſheth the ſoul vnto Sanctification of life. Whereby he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictes S.

                  </p>
                  <p>Item he is an enimy to the Churches Councils, for in his <hi>Tabulae ſuffragiales.</hi> Tab. 22. he renders them liable to errour, in as much, as they may (ſays he) endeuour to make that an article of faith, which was not afore, and by ſo endeuouring, fall into errour, and preſs the ſame errour vpon the whole Church. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides in his Muſcarium, (flye-flap) he accuſeth the Council of Calcedon (one of the four firſt generall Councils, which S. Gregory reuerenc'd as the 4. Euangils) to haue erred indeed.</p>
                  <p>Item he is an enimy to young children, for as much as he teacheth in his Muſcar. pag. 49. nu. 2. that liu'd faith, that is, faith working by Charity (whereof young children are not capable) is a neceſſary requiſit to Baptiſm, which is an hereſy of the Anabaptiſts condemned by the Council of Trent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:108708:69"/>Item he is iniurions to Charity it ſelfe To. 1. Inſt. pag. 89. for whereas S. Paul affirmes, that it is infus'd into the ſoul of man by the Holy Ghoſt, he teacheth that tis produced by our own actions.</p>
                  <p>Item he is iniurious to euery man for, in his booke of Gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Obedience pag. 38. <hi>It follovv's not,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that I vvrong him</hi> (an other man) <hi>euen though I do him harme, or ſeek his ruine, for he is no othervviſe to me, then a piece of cloath, or vvood, vvhich I cut and ſhape after my ovvn vvill fittingly for my vſe.</hi> They are his expreſs words.</p>
                  <p>Item he is deſtructiue of free will, becauſe he teacheth queſt. Theolog. §. 9. that our free will is neuet more free, then when it is neceſſitated.</p>
                  <p>To theſe prophane, and wicked Doctrines I ſhould adde many others, cenſured by the famous ad much renown'd Vniuerſity of Do way as hereticall, erroneous, dangerous, ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, and impious reſpectiuely, if the cenſure it ſelfe, and its gallant vindication were not already ſpread in our Country: wherefore it ſhall now ſuffice to haue ſet down this ſmale draught of his exotick, and abominable Tenets, it alone giuing euidence enough of the manifeſt weaknes that Dr. Ellis, Mr. Curtis &amp;c. haue shewn by their vnaduiſed Teſtimony of his <hi>Vnimpeachable vertue,</hi> and eminent <hi>Learning,</hi> and for as much as Mr. Blacloe hath publiſh'd the ſaid Teſtimony in the latine tongue to the ſight of the world, the Clergy of England will beare the infamous brand to all poſterity of being Mr. Blacloes Adherents, and Proſelites. And whereas Dr. Ellis &amp;c. be onely 9. Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and their Teſtimony goes vnder he name of the London Clergy, it will appeare, that as the Adherents to wicleff ſtole the ſeale of the Vniuerſity of Oxford, and craftily ſet it to the Chief Tenets of the ſaid wicliffe, that ſo the approbation of the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Oxford might get his learning credit, and credence abroad in Bohemia where it had taken ſome roott, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Dr. Ellis &amp;c. will be thought to haue ſtoln his Brethrens
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:108708:70"/>votes for the ſame purpoſe. Our moſt Rd. Biſhop <hi>(Cuius memoria in benedictione eſt)</hi> foreſaw the great ſcandals Mr. Blacloe would bring vpon himſelfe and his party, for in a Letter dated 6. of Feb. 1654. which his Lordſhip writ to my ſelfe (and I haue ſhewn it to our Seniors) are theſe expreſs words. <hi>I haue not yet ſeen Mr. Blacloes laſt book in which as you write there are ſuch horrid ſpeeches againſt the Popes infallibility, which if it be true, I feare Mr. Blacloe vvill goe yet further for ſuch ſpeeches ſhew the laſt diſpoſition to leaue the Pope, and then it will better appeare what kind of Aduerſaries you and I haue had.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now I leaue to the wiſedom's of our Brethren to iudge, out of the premiſes, whether Dr. Ellis, Mr. Curtis &amp;c. their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, which Mr. Blacloe in his weake Anſwere to the <hi>Vinditiae,</hi> ſet's down in theſe words. <hi>De me Cleri Londinatis Encyclica ad Fratres per Vniuerſam Angliam Epiſtola, hoc teſtimonium continet. Quantum ad Albij (Blacloi) perſonam attinet, nonimus eam ſemper vitae irreprehenſibilis &amp; exemplaris conuictus fuiſſe — ſcientiam ipſius eſſe eminentem fatentur omnes, quae nos ex legibus naturae &amp; Societatis humanae, cogit ad parem illi aeſtimationem retribuendam.</hi> Whether I ſay, the ſaid Teſtimony comming to the Popes notice, his Holines may, as to reaſon, be mou'd to confirm their Chapter, and giue them their own deſires as to a Succeſſour; or whether they may not haue a deſign to obſtruct thereby the good intentions of his Holines in order to a wiſh'd ſetlement of Gouernement in our Clergy, that ſo they may continue as they are in authority? Or whether Dr. Ellis could ſubſcribe vnto ſuch a Teſtimony with a good conſcience, ſince my ſelfe and others that I can name haue heard him call Mr. Blacloe an vnhappie man, and ſince he told a ſober learned Brother of ours (whoſe Letter I haue shewn) &amp; another perſon of great quality whom I can name, that part of his learning was <hi>Damnable. Vir duplex animo inconſtans eſt in omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus vijs ſuis. Iacob.</hi> 1. Again whether Catholicks for the future are bound to belieue Dr. Ellis, Mr. Curtis &amp;c. when they hear them deny their adherence to Mr. Blacloe, and his learning;
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:108708:70"/>furthermore whether they are not bound to embrace a learning which they iudge to be eminent, and know likewiſe the Author of it to be of an vnimpeachable vertue, and of a moſt vnblemiſht life. Furthermore whether Lay-Catholicks may do prudently to leaue the Charities they intend for the reliefe of the Mother-Houſe to be diſpos'd according to the inſtructions which Dr. Ellis, Mr. Curtis &amp;c. ſuggeſt to our Brethren in their Encyclicall Epiſtle to the great preiudice of the ſaid Mother-Houſe? <hi>Sed iuſſiſti Domine, &amp; ſic eſt, vt paena ſua ſibi ſit, omnis in ordinatus animus.

                  </p>
                  <p>Here Dr. Ellis &amp;c. proſtrated, offer their humble prayers to Heauen for Mr. Blacloes perſeuerance in the purſuance of his eminent learning vnto ſeruing the Church of God, by reſiſting of Hereticks. In this heauenly prayer they ſet down a falſe ſuppoſall, being I am certain, they can produce no euidence to proue that Mr. Blacloe hath compoſed works, which haue brought aduantages to the Church of God &amp;c. yet when I vſe this manner of ſpeech to any of his principall Proſelites, inſtantly <hi>Ruſhworth Dialogues</hi> are named, to which I haue and do ſtill reply that thoſe are no works of his; for though he beare the name of Thomas Blacloe, Thomas White, Thomas Anglus, Thomas Albiorum Trinobantum, and Thomas Bolton, neuertheleſs he was neuer called Mr. Ruſhworth. Again my ſelfe knew very well Mr. Ruſhworth, and that he alone was the true vndoubted Author of thoſe Dialogues (except onely ſome few blaſphemous and exotick propoſitions reſpectiuely, inſerted therein by Mr. Blacloe) To cleare this buſines vnto giuing to Mr Ruſhworth, what is due to Mr. Ruſhworth, who when I was but a Philoſopher executed the office of Generall Prefect in our Mother-Houſe, a graue, vertuous, and Religious Perſon, a good Diuine, and much verſed in Polemicall Theology, that is
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:108708:71"/>
                     <hi>In controuerſies,</hi> and when I was Agent for our Clergy, he wanting a Reſidence, I procured one for him in the Town of London, where he had the opportunity to conuerſe frequently with Mr. Blacloe (who then was in great eſteem, and vogue with all our ancient Clergy) and to communicate his conceptions, as to his Dialogues, hauing a great kindnes for him &amp; an opinion of his learning; The ſaid Mr. Ruſhworth not ſuruiuing to put forth his Dialogues, and Mr. Blacloe who euen then had conceiu'd prophane nouelties, thinking that the publiſhing of thoſe Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues (whereof he had a good opinion, as indeed they highly deſerued) might proue a fit forerunner for the eſtabliſhing of his own nouelle Doctrines, he borrowed the Manuſcript thereof from Mr. Edward Enderby Nephew to Mr. Ruſhworth, who is yet aliue, and without his leaue or knowledge printed it, and notwithſtanding that in the preface to the ſaid Dialogues, when they were firſt printed Mr. Blacloe does confeſs Mr. Ruſhworth to be the Author thereof, neuertheleſs Mr. Blacloes friends haue made him the Author vnto giuing credit and eſteem to his other writings, <hi>Sic vos non vobis mellificatis apes.</hi> Mr. Edward Ender by knows this to be true; and a certain knight of great worth, and learning with whom Mr. Ruſhworth communicated his ſaid Dialogues hath been heard to ſay (and he is aliue alſo) that ſundry poynts which are in the printed Dialogues were not in the manuſcript: which shew's euidently Mr. Blacloes crafty dealing, and the falſe ſuppoſall of Dr. Ellis, &amp;c. that Mr. Blacloes Workes haue been ſeruiceable to Gods Church, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 35. <hi>As alſo Dr. Leyb. mou'd to our Dean, and writ to Romè falſely pretending that the greater part of the Clergy would think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues happie in hauing a Vicarius Apoſtolicus, and that onely ſome few of the Chapter oppoſe it. Now to receiue ſuch an exterordinary Authority is both againſt the pleaſure of her Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> expreſt in her commands to our Agent at Rome not to accept it: againſt the lawes of our Catholick Anceſtors, againſt the will of our ſtate, and ſo moſt dangerous ſubiecting vs to a Premunire &amp;c.</hi>

                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:108708:71"/>For the ſatisfaction of out Brethren in order to this accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they may be pleas'd to know 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. that Dr. Gage their Agent writ vnto me, that he found his Holines willing to grant vnto vs a Biſhop, with the Title of <hi>Vicarius Apoſtolicus,</hi> and withall deſired me to giue my opinion and ſenſe, as to ſuch a gouernement, which I did accordingly, intimating in my Anſwer, that I did not doubt, but that all our Brethren (except ſome Chapter-men) would think themſelues happie to be ſo gouern'd; and am ſtill of that beliefe being aſſured, that our Clergy formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired nothing more of his Holines, then to enioye a Spirituall Gouernour inueſted with Epiſcopall authority, as doe the Clergy and Catholicks of Holland. Secondly what Dr. Gage, their Agent, writ vnto me, as to the matter in debate, the ſame alſo, he communicated in a Letter to Mr. Car, as himſelfe told me, who withall added, that he ſaw nothing of reaſon, that ſhould moue our Clergy to reiect ſo faire an offer: and truly I ſee no reaſon wherefore Beggers ſhould be ſo their own Caruers, as to refuſe a conſiderable Almes or Charity that is preſented <hi>Gratis.</hi> Hereupon I writ vnto Mr. Knightly complaining, that the Chapter wrong'd our Clergy extreamely, for as much as they had refuſed ſoe aduantageous a requiſit vnto making them happie; Mr. Knightly imparted the contents of my Letter to Dr. Ellis, who to excuſe the carriage of that buſines, writ vnto me in theſe words: <hi>VVe vvould be content vvith any Biſhop, but the Court of Rome vvill giue vs none;</hi> Whereby is plainely euidenced, that I writ not to Rome falſely, ſince the venerable Dean Dr. Ellis writeth: <hi>VVe vvould be content vvith any Biſhop &amp;c.</hi> Whereas Dr. Ellis &amp;c. excep againſt the Title of <hi>Vicarius Apoſtolicus,</hi> as importing an Eccleſiaſticall dignity that our moſt gracious Queen forebid Dr. Gage to accept, for as much, as it is inconſiſtent with the lawes of our Anceſtors, the will of the ſtate, and the good of the ſubiect, making all men liable to a <hi>Praemunire,</hi> that adhere vnto it. Now as to this poynt in debate I cannot be eaſily induced to belieue that our gracious Queen commanded Dr. Gage not to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:108708:72"/>accept of the Popes offer, as to a <hi>Vicarius Apoſtolicus,</hi> though there had been iuſt ground enough for her Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> to haue inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed her authority againſt it; I conceiue that our ſaid gracious Queen, for the extream reſpect ſhe hath euer ſhewn towards the ſea Apoſtolick, did onely intimate the inconueniences, that had been inculcated vnto her craftily, as to the admitting of ſuch a Spirituall Gouernour; I ſay craftily, becauſe Mr. Blacloe had perſuaded his pack of Chapter-men to except againſt the Title of <hi>Vicarius Apoſtolicus,</hi> as importing an Authoritie againſt the ancient Statutes of our Country made about the 13. or 17. yeare of Richard the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. a Catholick Prince, and vnrepealed in part, which ſtatutes Dr. Ellis &amp;c. vnad uiſedly call the lawes of their Anceſtors, ſaying <hi>Our Anceſtors.</hi> Alſo againſt the ſtate, which were (when this buſines was mou'd) Cromwell and his grand Council; likewiſe againſt the good of the ſubiect, whom ſuch a power makes liable to a <hi>Praemunire</hi> according to the ſaid ancient ſtatutes; This is the ſum or ſubſtance of what the Chapter inculcated as I imagine, and was pretended to our Brethren outwardly, vnto hindring the making of a Biſhop with the Title of <hi>Vicarius Apoſtolicus;</hi> whereas, indeed, Mr. Blacloe, and his London Chapter-men's ſole motiue of that their proceeding was in regard they apprehended that his Holines might elect a Brother to that office, who ſhould be an enimy to prophane nouelties, and conſequently no friend to their wayes. Beſides they knew well, that ſuch a Biſhop would beare rule ouer the Chapter, and all the Prieſts of England, and Wales, ſo that the dominion the Chapter has now, as to gouerning, would be made thereby to ſignify nothing. This I ſay, was their ſole motiue, wherefore they excepted againſt a Biſhop, with the Title of <hi>Vicarius Apoſtolicus,</hi> and will except againſt any Biſhop who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, if they ſhall conceiue that he is like to diſcountenance the London-Chapter-men.</p>
                  <p>As to the reaſons which Dr. Ellis &amp;c. alleadge againſt a <hi>Vicarius Apoſtolicus,</hi> they carrie no weight with them 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. becauſe
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:108708:72"/>a meer Biſhop, a Prouinciall or Preſident of an order, or any Apoſtolicall Miſſionary, ſent by the Pope into England without the kings leaue, is as much againſt the ancient ſtatutes of our Country, as a <hi>Vicarius Apoſtolicus,</hi> ſent without the kings leaue alſo. Secondly there are no lawes ancient or moderne that will hang a Biſhop as Biſhop, or a <hi>Vicarius Apoſtolicus</hi> as <hi>Vicarius Apoſtolicus,</hi> though they be ſent into England without the kings leaue; but our moderne lawes will hang each Apoſtolicall Miſſionarie that is a natiue if conuicted to be a Prieſt, or to haue taken orders beyond the ſeas, though he be but a meer Deacon; whereby tis plain, that the exception againſt the Popes giuing of a <hi>Vicarius Apoſtolicus,</hi> might with more reaſon be made againſt his Holines giuing Apoſtolicall Superiors, and all Apoſtolicall Miſſionaries whatſoeuer, becauſe the ancient lawes of Richard the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. vnrepealed are againſt theſe for as much as they are ſent without the kings leaue: and the moderne lawes of Queen Elizabeth are more ſeuere againſt them in as much as they are Prieſts, and haue taken orders beyond the ſeas.</p>

Hon. Ladyes, one allow'd him 10. l. ſtar. per. an. and the other 50. ſh. or 3. l. per an. Beſides I had done ſundry other ciuilities, and neuer had conteſt with him. Secondly as to Mr. Hammond the aſperſion is ſo falſe, that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:108708:73"/>as God beſt knows I neuer gaue him angry word in all my life. Thirdly as to Mr. Harrington, he and Dr. Holden, were Mr. Blacloes Cheefeſt Proſelites, which was an occaſion of a cold correſpondence between them, and me: but before Mr. Harrington eſpous'd Mr. Blacloes pernicious Doctrines, I had procured for him 300. l. ſtar. who afore was not worth 300. groates. Fourthly, as to Mr. Herbert, I was his greateſt Benefact our, and extreame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lou'd him vpon the ſcoare of that friendſhip, which we had contracted in our Mother-Houſe yet told him ſundry tymes between him, and me that his adhering to Mr. Blacloe would be the ruine of our Clergy. And dying he left me a legacy, and his old Mother an other. Fiftly, as to Mr. Southcot, I had alwais a great reuerence towards him as the moſt principall member of our body, and if the ſupreme prouidence had preſeru'd but his life, the ſcandals which are faln vpon our Clergy had been preuented, for he was a perſon of great authority with all ſort of Catholicks, and to my knowledge had a great diſlike of Mr. Blacloe, euer after he refuſed to recall the approbation afore mentioned: Sixtly as to Mr. Gage, and, Mr. Curtis to them were committed the fruits of Mr. Southcot's and my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, to be managed for the good of our body; I neuer wrongd either of them in all my life to my knowledge; I haue repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended Mr. Gage ſundry tymes, and gaue him good Counſell, which if he had embraced, he might haue departed out of this world more with his honour then he did. Seauenthly as to Mr. Clifford he is a perſon of great worth, honour, and vertue, I appeale to him ſelfe, being he is aliue, whether euer in my life I haue calumniated him, or caſt vpon him any one affront as Dr. Ellis, Mr. Curtis &amp;c. aſſert in this charge. The others afore mentioned are dead ſaue Mr. Peterſon, and therefore I cannot appeale to them, and if Mr. Peterſon, alias Mr. Curtis I haue calumniated, let him proue the calumny, and I will aske him forgiuenes and make reparation to my power, in the mean tyme <hi>Conſcientia mea non me accuſat:</hi> eightly as to Mr. Manly who

Ninthly as to Dr. Blundeſton, <hi>Requieſcat in Pace;</hi> I neuer heard that he is his life tyme complaind of my wronging of him: Tis true I haue endeuoured to draw him from Mr. Blacloes wayes of Doctrine. Tenthly as to Mr. Green he has a great kindnes for me, and this Mother-Houſe, for which he hath done more ciuilities then Dr. Ellis, and all the other eight that call themſelues vnaduiſedly the <hi>Church of the English Clergy.</hi> Beſides Mr. Green is my Benefactour, I haue receiued ſundry conſiderable preſents from him, and in his laſt Letter writ about 20. dayes agoe he ſignifyes that he hath ſent me a new preſent, which giue euidence enough to proue Dr. Ellis &amp;c. their accuſation to be meer calumny to render me odious to all my Brethren. <hi>Iuſſiſti Domine &amp; ſic eſt, vt paena ſua ſibi ſit omnis inordinatus animus.</hi>

As to the firſt I anſwer', if he had an vnſetled brain, it was more then I knew when I preſented him to orders: I was onely entreated by a worthy friend to make him Prieſt, that he might be ſent to <hi>Noſtre Dame des Vertues,</hi> and as God beſt know's I was not acquainted till after he had receiued orders, that he had weakned his brain by ſtudying too hard, or through ſcruples, when he liu'd in the Colledge of Rome: howeuer I gaue him entertainment <hi>Gratis</hi> for about one yeare, and a halfe, before he was preſented to holy orders, during which tyme he perform'd the exerciſes of our Houſe very handſomely at which my ſelfe was preſent; and truly he was eſteem'd a pious, and vertuous perſon, and although in regard of the weaknes of his head he wanted ſtrengh to perform the many, and long exerciſes, which were exacted of ſuch, as the Houſe of <hi>Noſtre Dame of vertue</hi> admitted, and therefore was returnd vnto me again, neuertheleſs he brought a Teſtimony of his pious comportement, in ſo much that I employed him in teaching of Grammar, and figures, for he was a Humaniſt ſufficient enough, deſirous to haue more triall of him before he ſhould be ſent into the miſſion; and truly when I was laſt in England, I made diligent enquiry, as to his comportements, and I could heare nothing reported amiſs; and whereas Dr. Ellis &amp;c. publiſh in print that he wiſhd his throat had been cut vvhen he took orders, tis not the part of either Prieſt, or Chriſtian to take away the good name of his Brother vpon a meer <hi>As we are inform'd:</hi> beſides the information (which they do not produce neither) is certainly falſe, as all this family belieues, hauing heard nothing at any tyme comming from the ſaid Brother that carryed the leaſt ſound that way. <hi>Tolerabiliores ſunt fures, qui veſtes, &amp; alia bona noſtra diripiunt, quam fures qui famam noſtram lacerant.</hi>

                  <p>As to the ſecond Miſſionary Dr. Ellis &amp;c. ſtile him in <hi>a manner phreneticall;</hi> although they would not take it well, if any ſhould call them phanatick, for as much as they hauing their itching Eares, do after their own luſts adhere to a maſter of new notions, which is to be phanaticks indeed, and the ſaid Miſſionary is in a manner phreneticall onely as they ſay. It does not beſeem per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of their call, to ſharpen their ſlandering tongues againſt a Brother, that deſerues great ciuilities from them for many reſpects: 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. he is deſcended of a noble Catholick family. Secondly he is a Prieſt, that is, Chriſt miniſter. Thirdly he is a Dr. of Phiſick, and the ſcripture bid's vs to do honour vnto Phyſitians. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 38.</p>
                  <p>Whereas Dr. Ellis &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> aſſert that the ſaid Brother vvas within ſix or ſeauen <hi>Moneths at moſt, a marryed man, widdower, Prieſt, and Miſſionary.</hi> They vnaduiſedly adde the particles, <hi>At moſt.</hi> For if they will make a true computation of the tyme from his wifes death, vntill his going into England, they ſhall find the ſpace of a whole yeare at leaſt. But this matters not much, ſince he was legally ordaind; and about the ſame tyme our Organiſt's Father vvas a marryed man, widdower, and Prieſt within tenne Months ſpace. Again I did not preſent the ſaid party with deſign to engage him in the miſſion, nor licenced him to goe into his Country for longer tyme then might be requiſit vnto diſpatching his affairs, which he had left imperfect. Beſides in receiuing of Orders his ſole deſign vvas to auoide the tentations of the vvorld, contenting him ſelfe with the ſmal Rents his elder Brother had left him in theſe Countryes, and ſetled on our Mother-Houſe in caſe he ſhould haue no iſſue. But the true reaſon vvherefore Dr. Ellis &amp;c. ſtile him phreneticall, is becauſe he hath ſignd to a diſclaim from Mr. Blacloes pernicious Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, and indeed ſome of that pack, as tis ſignifyed to me, called that vertuous and learned man Father Angelo Prouinciall of the Recollects <hi>Madman,</hi> becauſe he had publiſh'd a command to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:108708:75"/>all his Order vnto the deteſting of Mr. Blacloes learning, and all the Religious orders of our Country were reſolu'd to do the like.</p>
                  <p>As to the third Miſſionary Dr. Ellis &amp;c. call him <hi>A man of wild mad nature,</hi> and ſay, that he was expelled by me for open ſedition. I anſwer that his fault was not of ſoe great malice, as to deſerue the brand of open ſedition; being onely a ſcandalous diſorder committed our of frailty, vvhich vvas not ſo deadly neither, but that I intended to pardon, and had pardoned him after a fatherly chiding, vvherein my zeale told him, that I would turne him out of the Houſe, to which he replyd, that I durſt not, which anſwer truly mou'd me to vſe ſeuerity aboue my naturall inclination, leaſt it might appeare, that I had vnpreſidented my ſelfe by yeelding to a ſubjects menacing of me: howeuer I did not expell him the Colledge, but diſmiſs'd him onely without faculties, and afterwards at the entreaty of all the family in a manner (which did not count him <hi>A man of a vvild mad nature</hi>) and eſpecially at the interceſſion of a Rt. Hon. perſon his friend, and in regard of his own ſubmiſſion, I gaue him faculties; knowing well that he had good abilities. If euery diſmiſſion taken in the proper ſenſe might be cald on expulſion, Mr. Iohn Singletons departure from this Houſe might be term'd an expulſion, for his vnquiet Spirit, which before had rebelled againſt my Predeceſſour, Bleſſed Mr. Muſket, conſtrain'd me to diſmis him, though I delt more nobly with him, then he hath delt gratefully with his old Mother. Again vpon the ſame ſcore Mr. Holland the now Secretary of the Chapter his departure from the Colledge of Liſboa might be call'd expulſion, for Mr. Bradford (Gods peace be with him) and others of the ſaid Colledge now aliue, which I charitably entertain'd, told me that his Preſident not liking his proceedings ſent him into England.</p>
                  <p>But now to come more cloſe to Dr. Ellis in order to the charge ſet down againſt me, I am able to object more clearly his miſgouernement during his Preſidentſhip ouer Liſboa Colledge. 10.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:108708:75"/>he made Mr. Bradford Deacon, though he told him he did did not think that he was come to yeares required by the Churches Canons for the receiuing of that order, and indeed he wanted a competent age, as him ſelfe hath ſaid, and there are now ſome in this Colledge that can witnes as much. Beſides he diſpatch'd him away, whence he came to this Mother-Houſe with intent to receiue the order of Prieſt-hood, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate his ſtudies, and I receiu'd him into our family, where he continued aboue 3. yeares extreamly gratefull to me, and ciuil to euery one, and truly he was a young man of a ſingular good nature.</p>
                  <p>Secondly Dr. Ellis made one Mr. Williams Prieſt in his Logick, and before he heard either Philoſophy, or Diuinity ſent him into England, and him I receiu'd into our Houſe out of meer compaſſion, gratis: as likewiſe afore 4. or 5. others of the ſaid Colledge of Liſboa, onely 50. l. ſtar. being exacted for the entertaining of them all, and Dr. Ellis was engaged to pay the ſaid ſumme, which notwithſtanding he does not ſatiſfy though he hath been often vrg'd to perform his engagement, which he know's in his conſcience to be a due debt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly Dr. Ellis made Mr. Holland Prieſt ſoon after his being receiued into the Church; and before he was grounded either in Scholaſticall or Morall Theology came Miſſionary into England, and for the greate zeale he had ſhewn at Liſboa towards Mr. Blacloes new notions of Philoſophy, and for his readines in writing of English (who had been ſcribe to the Biſhop of Durham afore) he (Mr. Blacloe) cheriſh'd and employed, and finding him very nimble, wanton, and actiue, as to maintaining, and ſpreading of his new Doctrines, prefer'd him to be ſecretary of the Chapter, that ſo he alone might hold the penſill to repreſent the ſcene of affairs to our Country Brethren as he ſhould iudge expedient for the carrying on of Mr. Blacloes deſigns: and indeed all orders, and intelligences both at home and abroad come from him. Neuer did our ancient Clergy or any other commit
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:108708:76"/>ſo great an errour, as to prefer a young raw <hi>Neophite</hi> to ſuch a Charge contrary to the expreſs aduiſe of the Apoſtle leaſt puffed vp with pride, he fall into the iudgement of the Deuill. 1. Timo. 3. the word <hi>Neophite,</hi> (which taken in the proper ſenſe ſignifies ſuch, as are newly baptized) ancient Fathers extend to all ſuch as be newly retired from prophane wayes, (S. Hier. Ep. 83. ad Die. &amp; Dialo. ad Lucif. C. 5.) of whom good triall ought to be taken, before they ought to be preferred to Eccleſiaſticall Charges; &amp; either confirm'd by miracle, which occaſioned S. Ambroſe Eccleſiaſticall perferment; or by gallant writings againſt all prophane nouelties, which cauſed S. Auſtin's preferment after his deliuerance from the Manichean Hereſy; or by a vertuous and exemplar life togeather with competent learning, which hath exalted ſundry of our Nation ſince the Change of Religion. But Mr. Holland ſuddenly after he had abiur'd the errours in which he was bred, embraced the prophane nouelties of Mr. Blacloe, whereby appeares plainely, that he hath been preferd vnaduiſedly, and indeed, as to him the Apoſtles Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick caution is come to paſs. From the premiſes appeares that Dr. Ellis ſaw a mothe in his Brothers eye, not conſidering the beame that is in his own eye. Lu. 6.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 40. <hi>But by his (Dr. Leyb.) refuſing to ioyn with vs in obtaining one of the ſix propos'd for a Biſhop, and by diuers other paſſages we omit, he makes the common report, and opinion an euident truth, that he intends to make himſelfe our Superiour.—He intends to make himſelfe Paramount, vncontrolable &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to my refuſing to ioyn &amp;c. perhaps Dr. Ellis &amp;c. hint at Mr. Progers denying to ſigne the Tranſactions of the meeting afore mentioned, held 1657. otherwiſe I know not what is meant hereby, for not any one of them euer required my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, as to the procuring of one or more Biſhops; and whereas Mr. Progers refuſed to ſubſcribe vnto the tranſactions of the ſaid meeting he had great reaſon to do ſo, ſince the ſaid meeting did not proceed according to the agreement expres'd in
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:108708:76"/>his Inſtructions; beſides I gaue Mr. Progers an abſolute order not to act any thing, as to that meeting, vnleſs Mr. Clifford were preſent at it, whoſe Counſell togeather with my Lord Abbot Montague his inſtructions, I wishd him to obſerue punctually: wherefore Dr. Ellis &amp;c. after their wonted manner vnaduiſedly, haue caſt vpon me this particular aſperſion: and whereas fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they accuſe me in the ſaid charge, as intending to make my ſelfe <hi>Superiour, Paramount, Vncontrolaeble &amp;c.</hi> they manifeſt thereby an extream peruerſnes in their violent wayes. Becauſe at my laſt heing in London, I perceiuing, that they were affraid, leaſt I might come to beare rule ouer them, I aſſured Dr. Ellis, Mr. Curtis, Mr. Manly, and others of the Chapter, that I had no other ambition then to get them to diſclaim from Mr. Blacloes impious Doctrines, to the end our Clergy might recouer the credit, and honour which they had loſt both at home, and abroad thereby, and withall proteſted ſincerely in the word of a Chriſtian, and Prieſt, that vpon this condition of diſclaiming, I would be bound to refuſe whatſoeuer Superiority, or Iuriſdiction his Holines might intend to confer on me in order to them Moreouer I offered with the ſame aſſeueration, that I would be obliged likewiſe, to diſpoſſeſs my ſelfe of my Preſidentship to make room for ſome other deſeruing member of our Clergy, that may haue better abilities to bring greater aduantages to our Mother-Houſe; and thus much I offer again (for the preſeruing of our ſaid Clergy's honour) on the condition afore-mentioned, and shall not faile in the performance of my engagement, or otherwiſe let me fall in the opinion of all our Brethren, and Lay-Catholicks of England. Moreouer I will be bound to leaue our Mother-Houſe in a better condition then euer it has been in any tyme of my Predeceſſours. Thus much in Anſwer to the Encyclicall Epiſtle (that came to my hands about a moneth agoe) whereunto I was mou'd for ſundry pregnant reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">10. that I might heale my wounded Innocency with the euidence of truth. <hi>Qui lapide feritur quaerit medicum: ictus autem calumniae
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:108708:77"/>grauius, quam lapides feriunt. Eſt enim calumnia claua, &amp; gladius, &amp; iaculum incurabile, vt dixit Salomon: ſed his veritas mederi poteſt, qua ubi negligitur, vulnera accepta acerbiora fiunt. S. Athanaſ. Apolog. ad Conſtant.</hi> Blows from ſlandering tongues wound more grieouſely, then ſtones, clubs, ſwords, or dartes, and truth onely can cure the wounds which they inflict, in ſo much that truth being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, the wounds grow wider.</p>
                  <p>Secondly that ſo I might lay open the crafty dealings, which Dr. Ellis &amp;c. haue vſed to draw our Brethren vnto an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with Mr. Blacloe and themſelues, which if eſpouſed of neceſſity will bring vtter ruine: his <hi>eminent</hi> learning, and their ſupporting of it, tending that way.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, for as much, as I was informd that Dr. Ellis &amp;c. had not onely ſpread their Encyclicall Epiſtle amongſt our Brethren, but euen amongſt lay-Catholicks, and likewiſe ſent it into France, and theſe Countryes. From Bruſſels a worthy perſon writeth vnto me thus. <hi>I am very ſorry to ſee the Clergy carryed avvay with Mr. Blacloes vnholſome Doctrines to its great diſhonour, and that the Chapter-men in London are ſo factious, and diſunited from many others, as I perceiue by their ſcandalous Epiſtle put out in order to your ſelfe:</hi> This Letter I haue communicated to our Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors.</p>
                  <p>Furthly I was mou'd to put forth my Anſwer for two other reaſons, which <hi>eſpecially</hi> preuail'd with me. The one is, becauſe I am Preſident of the Mother-Houſe, ſo that the many great affronts, and foul aſperſions which the Encyclicall Epiſtle caſt's vpon me, of neceſſity muſt reflect, and redound vpon her at leaſt in part; a wicked Huſban is a diſgrace to his wiſe though ſhe be good: and indeed my very ſoul would be ſwallow'd vp with grief to bear the infamous brand to all poſterity of being the firſt Preſident of the ſaid Mother-Houſe, that should carry the deadly guilt of ambition, faction, ſedition, and all mannet of Euills, which the Encyclicall Epiſtle accuſes me of.</p>
                  <p>The other ſpeciall reaſon is, becauſe Dr. Ellis &amp;c. in the Ency<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clicall
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:108708:77"/>Epiſtle menace our Mother-Houſe for as much as they do couertly ſtir vp our Brethren to deale with lay-Catholicks in manner afore expres'd. Since they conceiue an impoſſibility of preuailing with her to deuiate from the wayes of her ancient Gouernours, and the generall practice of Gods Church, they endeuour craftily to make her Children dependent of them. Howeuer I doubt not, but that the ſupreme prouidence will ouerthrow their inordinate deſign to her greater honour and Luſter; our English Catholicks can neuer be carryed away againſt their own Spirituall Mother, I ſay their own Mother, for in Chriſt Ieſus ſhe hath begotten many of their Anceſters through the Goſpel. This Colledge that was erected in Doway in the yeare 1568. (and conſequently her yeare of lubily is not farre of to the comfort of all her good Children) hath furnish'd the Catholicks of England with Prieſts and Paſtours, which haue miniſtred the Sacraments, preach'd Chriſtian Doctrine, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crific'd their lifes, vnto conſeruing the true faith of Chriſt amongſt them, euen diuers yeares afore any other Colledge or Monaſtery of English Miſſionaries was erected. So that this Mother-Houſe is not onely a Seminary of Paſtours, that hath ſent aboue a Thouſand Prieſts into England, but of Martyrs allo, for as much as about 140. of her Children haue shed their blood in the defence of Catholick Religion. Beſides this Mother-Houſe hath had to the number of about 40. Doctours of Diuinity as Dr. Allan the firſt Preſident, afterwards Cardinall, Stapleton, Briſtow Kelliſon, Stratford, and others, <hi>Quorum memoria in benedictione eſt,</hi> which in regard of their famous writings, haue brought many wandring ſheepe to the folde of S. Peter. Wherefore this Mother-Houſe being ſo ſupported with Paſtours Confeſſours, Martyrs and Doctours (confiding in the prouidence of God, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed protection to the Citty of Hieruſalem for his ſeruant Dauids ſake 4. Reg.) ſhall I hope ſtand againſt all the Aſſaults of her Aduerſaties.</p>
                  <p>Now, <hi>much honored Brethren,</hi> tis high tyme to end this vnhappie
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:108708:78"/>conflict, (wherein I had not engaged my ſelfe if it had not been to vindicate my dead Lord our Spirituall Father, and Superior, my owne, and our old Mothers honour and innocency) onely giue me leaue in her name, (whoſe ſpeaker my office makes me) to preſent vnto you 4. ſpeciall requeſts as true Teſtimonies of her motherly affection, and piety.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that the prudent, and wiſe conduct which her old Children your elder Brothers, and Predeceſſours haue ſhewn in the ſetling and gouerning of our miſſion; may be vnto you a guiding Card to ſteer your actions by. The learned writings of her Doctours humbly and ſoberly deliuered in full conformity to the generall practice of Gods Church, the extream labours of her Paſtours carefully exerciſed, and valiantly endured vnto conuerting of ſouls, and the bloody ſacrifices of her Martyrs piouſly, and clearefully offered in confirmation of the truth hath ſown the ſeed, that hath preſeru'd, continued, and encreas'd Catholick Religion in our Country.</p>
                  <p>Secondly that our late bleſſed Biſhop, Spirituall Father, and Superior his conſtant peaching againſt prophane nouelties, may draw your harts from being carryed away with euery winde of Doctrine. As S. Iohn the Euangeliſt perpetually exhorted his Children vnto reciprocall Charity commanding them to loue one another; ſo our moſt godly Biſhop, conſtantly perſwaded his Children vnto an abhorrence of <hi>ſingularity, and nouelty,</hi> telling them that theſe were the marks of an Heretick. The reaſon that mou'd his Lordſhip to inculcate this paſtorall caution ſo often, was, becauſe if Paſtours entertaine wicked Doctrines, doubtleſs they will ſuffer them to take root in their Iuriſdictions, or diſtricts in conſequence of which, they ſhall bring many ſouls to euerlaſting ruine.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly that you will take into your ſerious conſiderations the Religious Acts of your two laſt Deans to wit, Mr. Fitton, and Dr. Daniell, both wiſe experienc'd men, and great Louers of Mr. Blacloe, who notwithſtanding ſhew'd at laſt their great
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:108708:78"/>diſlike of his learning for Mr. Fitton vpon his deaths-Bed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered vp his books to the Inquiſitor of Florence telling his Executours, that they were already, or would be condemned: and Dr. Daniel ſoon after he was elected Dean declared a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to diſclaime from his learning, and without doubt would haue done ſo, if he had ſuruiu'd one halfe yeare longer; and indeed he had ioyn'd with me in a Letter to our Brethren long afore, that preſs'd them to an vnanimous diſclaim both from Mr. Blacloe, and Dr. Holden's learning.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly our old Mothers requeſt is that you will be myndfull of the Counſell which S. Gregory the great our Patron and Apoſtle of England often inculcated to his flock, that is, <hi>Si obedientes fuerimus praepoſitis, Deus obediet orationibus noſtris.</hi> For as much as Ioſhua was obedient to God, God was obedient to his prayer vnto ſtaying the ſun in the middes of Heauen vntill the people of Iſrael auenged themſelues vpon their enimyes: but S. Gregory means not by the particles <hi>ſi obedientes fuerimus praepoſitis</hi> onely the ſupreme Superiour, that is God alone, but all his vice-gerents vpon earth both ſpirituall and ciuil, and our old Mothers requeſt is that you giue to all Superiours their duty for there is no Superiority but of God, and whoſoeuer reſiſteth Superiority, reſiſteth the ordinance of God, and thereby ſhall receiue to himſelfe damnation; wherefore you ought vnder paine of eternall damnation to giue to Caeſar what is due to Caeſar, and to the Biſhop of Rome what is due to him: theſe being Gods principall Vice-Gerents on earth and your Chiefeſt Superiours; and Catholick Religion teacheth that obedience of neceſſity is due to each of them, to the one in order to ſpirituall, to the other in order to ciuil Matters. He that taketh from Caeſar to giue to the Pope, and he that taketh from the Pope to giue to Caeſar, they both are abomination to God, whoſe will is that we giue to all Superiours their duty. Thus hauing preſented our old Mothers Requeſts, I ſubſcribe my ſelfe</p>

And as to the aſperſion caſt on me, if I might know, that I were accuſed to haue acted any one thing vnto diſturbing of my Caeſar, it should be needleſſ to deliuer me up, for I would preſent my ſelfe voluntarily to his miniſters for the clearing of my Innocency from ſuch a deadly wickednes; and for taking away, ſo great a ſcandall from my Religion.</p>
                  <p>In like manner Mr. Blacloe in his <hi>Fly flap</hi> accuſeth me of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt the King of Spaine, ſaying that in the tyme of the warrs I <hi>entertained a ſpye ſent from France to the ruine of Belgium, though I know him for ſuch.</hi> This accuſation for as much as it dwell's vpon generall words, without producing of particular proof's, carries the marke of a calumny. Howeuer I conceiue what is hint's at, to wit, my admitting of Dr. Talbot vnto a night's lodging (who came out of France in the tyme of warres between the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and and moſt Chriſtian Kings, into Belgium, and profeſſ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly though he had the protection of Count Salazar Gouernour of Cambray, and the Marquis of Treſegny, Gouernour of Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay, in whoſe Houſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after wards he reſided, and the ciuility of the

                  <p>But I perceiue by this aſperſion caſt vpon me, how two or three of my Seniors caſt themſelues into grace With our London Chapter; I will not name them.
